1
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:04,417
1815 - Napoleon, removed from
power, took refuge on the island of Elba.

2
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,917
While his followers dream of his return,

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,317
the new royalist power hunts
them down mercilessly.

4
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,100
Arrests and executions continue to spiral
in a climate of civil war.

5
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,336
On a stormy night off the coast
of Cape Corso (Corsica),..

6
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
the merchant ship Pharaoh crosses
paths with a boat in danger...

7
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,042
You saved her.

8
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,875
Get me a blanket!

9
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,833
I told you not to go!

10
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,833
You're grounded!
I don't want to see you until Marseille!

11
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,750
What?

12
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,795
Do you find me brutal?

13
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,333
Not only do I know it,
but I take pride in it.

14
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,042
Come on!

15
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,767
Come on, everyone to your stations!

16
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,662
Get her dry, before she freezes to death.

17
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,792
Wait!

18
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:27,917
Come on!

19
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,208
Did you sleep well?

20
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,587
You have something that belongs to me.

21
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:14,625
I had never seen
the Emperor's handwriting.

22
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,197
Give me that letter back.

23
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,878
I don't think so, no.

24
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,750
What do you want?

25
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,875
A good reason not to report you.

26
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,500
Try money.

27
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,333
It often works.

28
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,583
I don't have any.

29
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,625
But I have friends.

30
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,833
If you talk about that letter,

31
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,958
they will find you and they will kill you,

32
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,833
Captain Danglars.

33
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,708
Sir?

34
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,500
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

35
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,333
I don't know how to thank you.

36
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,917
You just did.

37
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,750
Take care of yourself.

38
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,500
Miss...?

39
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,292
Angèle.

40
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,833
Edmond.

41
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,083
I will never forget your courage.

42
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,792
But forget my name.

43
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,500
Goodbye, Edmond.

44
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,250
Goodbye, Angèle.

45
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,054
Morrel wants to see you.

46
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,959
We had just changed shifts,
off the coast of Cap Corse.

47
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,209
The swell was strong.
We were 200 fathoms from the wreck.

48
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,708
Give me the logbook.

49
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,917
We were hitting the debris
when Dantès wanted to launch the lifeboat.

50
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,542
I forbade him. It was madness.

51
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,000
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,468
We would have done it for one of our men.

53
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:37,625
It was my decision.

54
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,917
- I took my responsibilities.
- I ordered

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,765
to change course, and he dove.

56
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,458
You dove?

57
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,417
He didn't forbid diving.

58
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,708
That's enough.

59
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,023
Did you see that insolence?

60
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,125
Mr. Morrel, I tell you,
this boy is uncontrollable.

61
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,361
I don't want to sail with him anymore.

62
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,208
- You will no longer sail with him.
- I warned you.

63
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,500
Because you will no longer sail for me.

64
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,042
Pardon?

65
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,625
How could you let her drown?

66
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,708
I... I saved your cargo,
Mr. Morrel.

67
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,817
Dantès saved my honor, Danglars.

68
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,153
- Captain.
- You are no longer captain.

69
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,333
Go prepare your things.

70
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,458
- I will arrange your pay.
- We don't know who that woman is.

71
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,042
I know what you did.
And that's enough for me.

72
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,417
Kid, come here.

73
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,292
Come on!

74
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,208
Let this be a lesson to you.

75
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,667
Huh?

76
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,375
When you are a man,
you don't hide behind your rank

77
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,958
or under a table.

78
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,792
I present to you

79
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,458
my grandson, Maximilien.

80
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,625
Nice to meet you, Maximilien.

81
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,542
Maximilien,
I present to you Captain Dantès.

82
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,875
Good day, Captain.

83
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,333
So, how old...

84
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,125
Captain?

85
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,333
Yes, try to be worthy of it, Edmond.

86
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,500
Of course, sir.

87
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,500
Of course.

88
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,583
Huh?

89
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:52,958
That's good.

90
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,167
Edmond!

91
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,917
I can't believe it.

92
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,625
I have to...
I have to tell you something.

93
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,875
That you love me?

94
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,125
Yes... that. But...

95
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,750
- No, there's no "but."
- Wait.

96
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,917
- But I...
- You're starting again.

97
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,917
You kiss a future captain.

98
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,164
- You're going to be...
- Yes.

99
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,958
- So we can...
- Yes. We can.

100
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375
I missed you.

101
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,458
I missed you. I missed you.

102
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,708
See you later.

103
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,167
Edmond!

104
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,542
- Juliette. Are you well?
- And you?

105
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,708
Yes.

106
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,708
- How are you?
- It's Edmond, Louis's son.

107
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,542
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

108
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,039
- Where's father? I need to see him.
- At home.

109
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
See you later.

110
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:13,833
You can smile,

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,917
it's good news.

112
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,000
You look serious.

113
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,958
It's joy.

114
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,417
I'm so proud of you.

115
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:27,958
Captain.

116
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,625
Captain.

117
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,520
Did you inform Mr. and Mrs. de Morcerf?

118
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,458
Not yet.
I wanted to tell you first.

119
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,875
Everything is going to change, father.

120
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,841
We have to announce it to them.

121
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,750
This is all thanks to them.
And to you, too.

122
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,583
I didn't pay for your naval studies.

123
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,417
Come on, go, my son.

124
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,125
Go pay your respects.

125
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,208
So, a toast! I raise my glass

126
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,500
to the memory of your mother, Edmond.

127
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,917
Because we miss her

128
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,084
and because she gave birth

129
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,209
to the youngest captain of Marseille!

130
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,333
- Bravo!
- Applaud him, he'll be embarrassed.

131
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,420
There you go, perfect.

132
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,417
But above all

133
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,333
because Mathilde Dantès

134
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,792
was the nurse of a future peer of France

135
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,375
with a heroic destiny,

136
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,719
one of the finest officers in Europe,

137
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,542
I name Fernand de Morcerf,
at your service.

138
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,625
Louis, come toast with us.
This is the occasion.

139
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,542
Thank you, sir.

140
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
Maybe later.

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,292
You can scold Mercédès.
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

142
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,583
You'll see,
she'll be late for her wedding.

143
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
- Ah, finally!
- Ah.

144
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,250
Excuse my delay,

145
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,333
aunt. Hello, uncle.

146
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,333
Horace de Balios

147
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,458
was being difficult.
I almost gave him a spanking.

148
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,083
But really, Mercédès.

149
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,667
Who is this gentleman?

150
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,209
He's a horse.
He's from a very good family.

151
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,875
- Hello, my cousin.
- Hello, my cousin.

152
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,333
Edmond.

153
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
Mercédès.

154
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:29,292
Are you ready to celebrate?
Edmond has great news.

155
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,958
Yes, yes.

156
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,417
Yes, I'm going to be captain.

157
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,028
Captain of the Pharaon. It's official.

158
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,635
- Is that true?
- Hm.

159
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,708
- Bravo.
- To the captain!

160
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,333
- I got it!
- Ah! To your health!

161
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:11,542
- I'm happy for you.
- Me too. I'm happy

162
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,667
- for me. To yours.
- Are you going to get a new uniform?

163
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,000
He nods.

164
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,167
And a new pay.

165
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,042
He'll be able to enjoy life,

166
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,750
have a good time.

167
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,329
We'll explain it to him.

168
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,072
I'm going to be able to marry, especially.

169
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,042
What?

170
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,917
You will be my witness.

171
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,792
- Don't count on it!
- Well, yes!

172
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,125
The witness to a waste!
Mercédès, say something.

173
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,417
- I tried, but he's madly in love.
- Ah, completely crazy.

174
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,500
And her, does she know?
Finally, is she in agreement?

175
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,417
Yes. From what she told me,

176
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,792
- yes, yes.
- I know.

177
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,292
It's Juliette.

178
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,375
- Who?
- The maid with the mischievous look.

179
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,667
No! No, it's not Juliette.

180
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,417
No, she's a real woman,

181
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,083
very beautiful.

182
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,958
Not just beautiful.

183
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,625
Hm.

184
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:09,208
- Mysterious and enchanting.
- Yes! No, no,

185
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,167
- yes, yes.
- But who is it?

186
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,375
It's your cousin.

187
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,375
Mercédès Herrera de Morcerf.

188
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,292
You?

189
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,459
- Yes.
- We're getting married.

190
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,583
But you're completely crazy.

191
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,667
And your mother will never agree.

192
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
You think mom will refuse me anything?

193
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,015
Then you'll convince her.
You've always been her favorite nephew.

194
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,791
AMEN!

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I bring here,

196
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,667
signed by Mr. de Villefort,

197
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,042
the King's prosecutor,

198
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,792
an arrest warrant
for the named Edmond Dantès.

199
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,792
Follow us.

200
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,017
What's happening?

201
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,834
- No, let him be.
- There must be an explanation.

202
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,625
- Come.
- Let me go.

203
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,917
- Wait.
- Fernand, do something!

204
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,542
What's wrong? My
son hasn't done anything.

205
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,833
It's definitely a misunderstanding.

206
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,125
Where are you taking him?
I'll go with you.

207
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,750
- We must take him alone, sir.
- Lieutenant.

208
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,682
Lieutenant Fernand de Morcerf.

209
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,135
Tell your friends to let us through.

210
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,792
It's a royal order.

211
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,417
I'll take care of it.

212
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,333
- Please follow us now.
- Edmond!

213
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,333
I'll be back, my love.

214
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,667
Edmond Dantès, Mr. Prosecutor.

215
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,958
Let us be.

216
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,333
I have always admired sailors
like you, Mr. Dantès.

217
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,625
I only fear the sea.

218
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,458
It's true, this endless abyss.

219
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,500
These black waters.

220
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,125
A monster always seems ready to emerge
to devour you.

221
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:29,667
What am I being accused of?
Why am I being arrested on my wedding day?

222
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,083
Do you have an enemy, Mr. Dantès?

223
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,167
An... an enemy?

224
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,042
Or a jealous one.

225
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:43,458
You've just been named captain,
you're going to marry a fine match...

226
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,792
You may have made some envious.

227
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,417
I don't know, no.

228
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,625
I had a disagreement recently
with a crew member,

229
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,616
but what could he accuse me of?

230
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,167
I don't know.

231
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,250
Of being a Bonapartist agent, for example.

232
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,333
Excuse me?

233
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,417
But... that makes no sense.

234
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,125
We found this Bible in your cabin.

235
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,000
Is this your Bible?

236
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,542
Your name is written in it.

237
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,875
Yes, but that's not a crime.

238
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,458
That's true.

239
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,833
But we also found
inside an order of mission

240
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,083
signed by Napoleon himself.

241
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,417
And that is a crime.

242
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,958
Wait.

243
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,750
No, this is the first time
I've seen this letter.

244
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,061
If you have no enemy,
who could have slipped it in there?

245
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,140
Off the coast of Cap Corse,
I saved a young woman from drowning.

246
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,833
Did she thank you in your cabin?

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,833
No.

248
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Danglars locked her up there.
She left in Marseille.

249
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,458
You can check.

250
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,667
Ask Quartermaster Gaspard Caderousse.

251
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,083
- Caderousse?
- Yes.

252
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,459
What do you know about her?

253
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:12,542
Nothing.

254
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,250
Mr. Dantès.

255
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,292
I've interrogated dozens of conspirators

256
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,552
and I believe you're not one of them.

257
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,833
I'm willing to help a
friend of the Morcerfs,

258
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,292
but I need you to help me.

259
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,079
I swear to you I know nothing about her.

260
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,758
She told me her name was Angèle.

261
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,667
That's all.

262
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,625
Did you...

263
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,708
reveal the name of this young woman
to anyone?

264
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,125
No.

265
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,583
Not even to that Caderousse?

266
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,125
No.

267
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,625
To no one. I swear.

268
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,167
Well, you see, Mr. Dantès,
I believe you.

269
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:07,250
However, I'm going to have to
keep you a bit longer,

270
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,959
until I can interrogate
the rest of the crew.

271
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:13,042
If they confirm your testimony,
which I have no doubt they will,

272
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,375
I will return you to your fiancée,
who will have plenty of time to hate me.

273
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,583
Count on her.

274
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,998
Fernand will bring you back.

275
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,792
I can't take it anymore, I'm going.

276
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,750
You can't do anything more.

277
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,690
It would suit you
if they didn't release him.

278
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,208
How can you say such horrors?

279
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,500
Gerard, whatever you've been
told about Dantès, I stand by him.

280
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,995
Let us be alone for a moment, gentlemen.

281
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,667
Fernand, I'm sorry for your friend.

282
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,750
I know your ties.

283
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,848
But you don't know everything.

284
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,000
We found an order of mission
from the Emperor on him.

285
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,927
And his crew members claim
he is one of his supporters.

286
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,888
I think you understand
the seriousness of these accusations.

287
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,459
He was arrested
before he could marry Mercédès

288
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,954
and before the irreparable was committed,

289
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,833
but if you are willing to vouch for him,

290
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,125
if you think these two men are lying...

291
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,059
If you are ready to take that risk,

292
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,875
then I will free him.

293
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,765
You only need to say one word.

294
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,375
No.

295
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,708
No?

296
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,583
He does not deserve...

297
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,083
He does not deserve what?

298
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,458
For our family name to be sullied.

299
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,208
If Dantès has betrayed us,

300
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,069
he should suffer the fate of traitors.

301
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,375
I can ensure...

302
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,667
that no trial will tarnish the
reputation of the Morcerfs.

303
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,042
I will need your testimony.

304
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,635
Do you understand what is happening?

305
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,458
Then keep your mouth shut.

306
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:35,750
- Mr. Dantès?
- Did you get to speak to the prosecutor?

307
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,542
Yes, sir.

308
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,125
This is a day I will never forget.

309
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,250
Aren't you taking me home?

310
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,042
No, indeed.

311
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,625
Go.

312
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,083
What's happening? What's happening?

313
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,083
Let me go.

314
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,959
Call the prosecutor.
I spoke with the prosecutor!

315
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,125
Call him. Call him!

316
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,833
I'm innocent! I did nothing!
Let me go.

317
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,375
Shh, shh, shh.

318
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,375
If you were guilty, they would have
hanged you. They're taking you away,

319
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,517
because you know things
that they don't want to hear.

320
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,750
Come on.

321
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,750
Stop.

322
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,917
Stop!

323
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,542
Let me go!

324
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,833
Where is he?

325
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,750
I couldn't do anything.

326
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,583
Mercédès.

327
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,375
Let me be.

328
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,333
It wouldn't help.

329
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,833
- Mercédès...
- Stop.

330
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,125
Please.

331
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,375
What's going on, Victoria?

332
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,833
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Your sister is here.

333
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,542
Mademoiselle de Villefort.

334
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,625
You wear your secrets well.

335
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,375
Sorry I can't return the compliment.

336
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,583
Cognac?
Sorry, I'm all out of seawater.

337
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,125
Yes, it's my job to know everything.

338
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,760
So you know that Dantès is innocent.

339
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,625
Innocent... Yeah.

340
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,780
But who is truly innocent?

341
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:44,042
He did nothing.
Why did you arrest him?

342
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,667
In order to save your life.

343
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,481
My life or your reputation?

344
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,458
We're both playing politics.

345
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,417
In politics, you don't eliminate a man,

346
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,083
you eliminate an obstacle.

347
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,208
I knew you practiced your profession
with cruelty,

348
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,964
but I had hoped
you at least did it honestly.

349
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,292
Why don't you confess in his place?

350
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,917
But I will, Gérard.

351
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,853
If you refuse to save him, I will do it.

352
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,175
But you would prefer
that my existence be ignored,

353
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,000
as well as that of Victoria,

354
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,292
your mistress,

355
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,208
and your future child.

356
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,833
Just as I thought.

357
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,870
CHATEAU D'IF PRISON
FOUR YEARS LATER

358
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,083
Alive?

359
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,750
Alive.

360
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,667
Alive?

361
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,708
Alive!

362
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,292
Alive?

363
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,625
Alive.

364
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,875
Take wide...
Stay clear of the coast...

365
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:05,208
And who knows the way...
Who knows exactly...

366
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,250
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

367
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,250
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

368
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,125
Is anyone there?

369
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,625
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

370
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,333
Is anyone there?

371
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,667
Who are you?

372
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,250
Uh, I... Dantès, Edmond Dantès.

373
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,750
How old are you?

374
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,708
- Your voice sounds like a young man's.
- I'm...

375
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,500
I don't know anymore.

376
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:57,208
I was 22...
when they imprisoned me.

377
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,542
On May 16, 1815.

378
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,542
That was four years ago.

379
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,958
You are 26 years old.

380
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,625
Four years?

381
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,542
And...

382
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,250
And you, who are you?

383
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,542
A prisoner.

384
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,375
Like you.

385
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,625
For how long?

386
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,708
Shh!

387
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,792
What?

388
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,375
- They're coming.
- Wait.

389
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,542
Don't leave me.

390
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,750
Who are you?
At least tell me your name.

391
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,125
Your name!

392
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,083
34! Alive?

393
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,333
Alive.

394
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,208
I was waiting for you.

395
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,708
Do you really think
you can get out of here?

396
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,817
I've dug 30 meters in six years.

397
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,042
To go around your cell
and reach the outside,

398
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,375
it will take twice as long.

399
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,375
12 years?

400
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:32,417
Maybe a little less,
now that we'll be two.

401
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,875
Why? Do you have other plans?

402
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,417
No.

403
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,083
I am Abbot Faria.

404
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,083
Edmond Dantès.

405
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,167
Had you ever seen this letter?

406
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,208
No, never.

407
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,292
And you?
Do you know why you are here?

408
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,375
Yes.

409
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:40,153
They wanted to silence you.
They wanted to make me talk.

410
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,458
<i>He speaks in Italian.</i>

411
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,708
I choose the people I confide in.

412
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,917
You don't know Italian?

413
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,333
- No.
- English, Arabic, Latin, Greek?

414
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,417
I only know the sea.

415
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,458
If you want, I'll teach you.

416
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,750
With patience and will, in...

417
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,532
in 6 or 7 years,
you will know everything I know.

418
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,958
History, philosophy,

419
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,708
mathematics.

420
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,583
These are...

421
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,292
These are weapons

422
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,083
that free just as much as this one.

423
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,417
Hm.

424
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,375
What is the first thing you will do

425
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,333
if we manage to get out?

426
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,333
I will find Mercédès.

427
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,456
What will you do
if she hasn't waited for you?

428
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,208
Then I will have nothing left.

429
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,500
I will tell you a story, Edmond.

430
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,042
Seven hundred years ago,

431
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,042
in Jerusalem, during the First Crusade,

432
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,750
the knights

433
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:12,329
charged with protecting the tomb of Christ
create the Order of the Templars.

434
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:13,750
On the first day,

435
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:17,542
they are just a few,
but they have immense faith.

436
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,458
Thanks to their victories,

437
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,667
the order amasses a fortune...

438
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,000
considerable.

439
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:31,333
Consi... Considerable.

440
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:37,182
I'm talking about the greatest treasure
the Earth has ever known.

441
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:39,417
And...

442
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,375
over time,

443
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,214
their power, their wealth,
makes them envied.

444
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:51,875
And on Friday, October 13, 1307,
the King of France, Philip the Fair,

445
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,000
orders their arrest

446
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,991
and the seizure of their goods.

447
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,375
But no one ever found the treasure.

448
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,708
Do you know...

449
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,292
what these knights did
with this immense fortune?

450
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,458
- No.
- Nothing!

451
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,208
Edmond, nothing.

452
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,750
Too busy seeking revenge,

453
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,375
punishing those who had betrayed them,

454
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,042
they died one after the other.

455
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,414
At least, almost all of them.

456
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,292
The last of them

457
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,708
was Cardinal Spada.

458
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:45,083
At the end of his life,
sheltered on the island of Monte-Cristo,

459
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,542
he had time to train one last knight.

460
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,292
This young man was called...

461
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,583
Giuseppe Faria.

462
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,500
I am the last survivor, Edmond.

463
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,208
And I know

464
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,250
where the treasure is.

465
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:10,958
Half of which

466
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,250
belongs to you today.

467
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,083
But what will you do with this fortune?

468
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,375
Will you do good

469
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:26,792
or will you let your heart
fill with hatred?

470
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:40,500
10 YEARS LATER

471
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,773
I'm going to empty the bag.

472
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,083
Edmond.

473
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,250
Huh?

474
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,250
It's salty.

475
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,167
The water, it's salty.

476
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:38,042
We're almost there.
It's a matter of days.

477
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:46,792
We're there, we're there.

478
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,618
I'll be right back.

479
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,833
Step back!

480
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,208
Abbot?!

481
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,250
Abbot! Abbot!

482
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,583
Here.

483
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,250
- Edmond.
- No, no, don't talk.

484
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,333
I'm going to call for help.

485
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
No.

486
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:42,750
(In Italian)
It's too late.

487
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,833
Don't be sad.

488
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:53,792
You have been the only comfort of my life.

489
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,667
The Lord gave it to me...

490
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,750
a little late, but he gave it to me.

491
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,583
I am not mad, Edmond.

492
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,667
I know.

493
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:12,167
The treasure exists.

494
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,375
You know where to find it.

495
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,667
We will go look for it together!

496
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,083
Don't forget.

497
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,625
Monte-Cristo.

498
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,542
Monte-Cristo.

499
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:28,958
Mount...

500
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,208
Don't leave me.

501
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,042
Don't leave me. Huh?

502
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,583
Don't leave me.

503
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,417
Alive?

504
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:05,792
Alive!

505
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,167
Alive?

506
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,375
Number 17?

507
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,750
Oh, 17!

508
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,208
Oh, abbot?

509
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:26,750
Oh! He is dead, throw the sack!

510
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,125
Which one is it?

511
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,708
It is the abbot.

512
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,875
Alive?

513
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Alive!

514
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,792
Alive?

515
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,542
Alive?

516
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,125
Stand up.

517
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,167
Stand up!

518
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,333
I said stand up!

519
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Alert!

520
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:01,625
ONE...

521
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,583
Alert!

522
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,208
TWO...

523
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,875
Alert!

524
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:08,375
AND THREE!

525
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,708
Hey! You shouldn't be here.

526
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:33,875
Go away!

527
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:37,417
I came to see Louis. Louis Dantès.

528
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,333
Did you know Louis?

529
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yes.

530
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,708
We buried that poor Louis.

531
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,333
A long time ago.

532
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,083
No, that can't be true.

533
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,250
He let himself die of hunger
after his son's death.

534
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,000
He wanted to join him.

535
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,292
But his...

536
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,333
But his son is not dead.

537
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,333
I'm sorry.

538
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,750
You were a sailor too?

539
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,417
- Yes.
- Hm.

540
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:24,523
I will give you something to eat.
But then you disappear, okay?

541
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:33,000
And Mercé... Mercédès?

542
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,583
And Fernand de Morcerf?

543
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,542
They haven't come by in 7 or 8 years.

544
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:42,429
They have been living in Paris
since the birth of their son.

545
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,083
You are too late.

546
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,917
Avoid the Ligurian Sea

547
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,000
and its endless patrols.

548
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,458
Set course for Sardinia.

549
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,583
You can stop at Santa Teresa di Gallura.

550
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:59,833
The island of Monte-Cristo is

551
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,417
to the west of the Tuscan Archipelago.

552
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:25,458
You will dock at the southern tip.

553
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:30,333
I know you will be overwhelmed
by its austere beauty.

554
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,750
I envy you for discovering it
for the first time.

555
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,208
There.

556
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:39,833
That's it.

557
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,292
The tomb of the illustrious Spada family.

558
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,167
The rest, Edmond,

559
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:48,708
is your story.

560
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:54,542
The story of a man who holds the world

561
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:57,167
in the palm of his hand.

562
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:25,000
MARSEILLE
ONE YEAR LATER

563
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:43,083
- I beg you, go ahead.
- Stop.

564
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,250
- I'll pay you tomorrow.
- No, no. Gaspard, get out.

565
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,667
M. Caderousse is my friend.

566
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:03,458
On his deathbed, Edmond Dantès
asked me to share with those

567
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:06,125
who mattered to him.

568
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:12,625
He thought he had been betrayed
by a certain Danglars.

569
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:18,167
But he was convinced that two men
had remained loyal to him.

570
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:19,583
He told me:

571
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,375
"One is named Gaspard Caderousse,

572
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:26,292
"and the second, Fernand de Morcerf."

573
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,542
Keep your diamond.

574
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,917
None of us deserves anything.

575
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,125
Wait, my son.

576
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:38,042
If I reveal what I know,
they will know it came from me.

577
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,542
And these people are rich and powerful.

578
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,792
You have nothing to fear,

579
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:46,042
I am bound by the secret of confession.

580
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,583
Have a seat.

581
01:01:56,375 --> 01:02:00,140
Dantès was right about Danglars.
He is the one who betrayed him.

582
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:06,542
But Fernand de Morcerf?
He was his friend.

583
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,552
Can one be a friend
to someone whose woman one covets?

584
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:14,250
Out of love for Mercédès,

585
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,417
he sacrificed Edmond.

586
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:25,958
He will live.
But to everyone, he will be dead.

587
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,042
Hm.

588
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:33,991
The only one who would have deserved
Dantès' affection is Morrel.

589
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,375
The shipowner?

590
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,417
He fought to free him.

591
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:43,292
And he too,
providence has rewarded him little.

592
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:46,083
After Dantès' arrest,

593
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,833
he had to take Danglars back as captain.

594
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,250
But Danglars betrayed him too.

595
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:54,208
He made half of his fleet disappear,

596
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,458
allegedly stolen by pirates.

597
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,875
Ruined, Morrel had to sell the company.

598
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,375
And guess who bought it for a pittance?

599
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,833
Danglars.

600
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:10,042
Two months later, the ships reappeared.

601
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,375
But the prosecutor Villefort didn't budge.

602
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,500
To be fair, they shared a secret.

603
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,708
Little Victoria, Villefort's mistress,

604
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,581
she had become Mrs. Danglars.

605
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,500
She is a baroness today

606
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:30,042
Morrel, on the other
hand, died in poverty.

607
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:36,458
And you, in all this, Mr. Caderousse?

608
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,292
You?

609
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:41,250
What could I do

610
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,875
against a captain,
a count, and a prosecutor?

611
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:51,583
If I had been braver,
I would surely have ended up like her.

612
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:53,542
Her?

613
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:55,625
Angèle.

614
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:02,208
She had gone to see her brother
to save Dantès.

615
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,709
I got rid of Dantès for you.

616
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:05,969
Now it's your turn to get rid of her.

617
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,167
You see? I have friends too.

618
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,500
What happened?

619
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:18,708
Did she get killed?

620
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,723
She would have suffered less.

621
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,625
Danglars had other plans for her.

622
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:29,209
He sold her to the Maillard brothers,
the masters of a brothel in Toulon.

623
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,833
The girl was pretty,

624
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,773
he got a good price for her.

625
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,792
You knew everything and did nothing.

626
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,083
I am ashamed, Father.

627
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:44,167
One day, I will return.

628
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:47,275
And I will offer you the chance
to redeem yourself.

629
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,042
I no longer come to plead or seek you out,

630
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,667
but only to warn you:

631
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,878
I am going to do what you could not do.

632
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:17,542
From now on,
I am the one who rewards and punishes.

633
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,458
Do you want something?

634
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,417
Who are you?

635
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,583
Years ago,

636
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,250
you told me:

637
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:51,875
"I will not forget your courage,
but forget my name."

638
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:58,000
Well, I have forgotten neither your name
nor your courage.

639
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,125
Dantès.

640
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:12,125
I came to find you, Angèle.

641
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,208
For me, it's too late.

642
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,167
But you can save the child.

643
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,292
The child?

644
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,917
When I arrived here,

645
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:42,500
I had only one idea in mind:

646
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,348
to take revenge on my brother.

647
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,708
For weeks, I looked for a way to escape.

648
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:57,542
One day, the opportunity presented itself.
I fled.

649
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,000
With a client.

650
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,667
A draper from Paris.

651
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,500
I knew Gérard had been appointed there.

652
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,750
I tracked down Victoria,

653
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,250
his mistress.

654
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,667
I wanted to pick up the story
where it had left off.

655
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,042
It was freezing cold.

656
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:32,792
That night...

657
01:08:32,957 --> 01:08:34,417
Gérard had to die.

658
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,042
Nothing could stop me.

659
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:42,832
I can still feel the metal of the knife
in my hand.

660
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:47,000
But nothing went as planned.

661
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,292
I heard a scream.

662
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,292
The scream of Victoria.

663
01:08:58,957 --> 01:09:03,167
When Gérard came out into the garden,
he was carrying a chest.

664
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,167
I followed him.

665
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:18,707
I got closer when...

666
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,832
I heard the muffled cries of a child.

667
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,375
I couldn't leave him.

668
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:37,487
He still had his mother's blood
on his body.

669
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,792
Between vengeance and life...

670
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,542
I chose life.

671
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,042
I fled with him.

672
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,167
I didn't know anyone in Paris.

673
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,792
So I returned to my draper.

674
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:11,833
But the Maillard brothers had found him.

675
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,831
And they were waiting for me.

676
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:23,917
Angèle...

677
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:29,047
What happened to the child?

678
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,083
Hello, André.

679
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:05,833
Angèle sent me to fetch you.

680
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:07,542
Why?

681
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,125
She is going to die.

682
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,292
I will take you to her
so you can say goodbye.

683
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:18,861
After, we will leave.

684
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:21,833
We will take...

685
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,792
all the time we need to be ready.

686
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,208
Ready for what?

687
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,833
To take revenge, André.

688
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:36,000
To take revenge on the three men
who stole her life,

689
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,208
yours

690
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:38,792
and mine.

691
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,667
- I want to kill them.
- That would be too easy.

692
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,333
Too sweet.

693
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:48,417
No.

694
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,208
We must rip out their hearts.

695
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,958
Who are you?

696
01:11:57,792 --> 01:12:00,167
I am the Count of Monte Cristo.

697
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,917
General de Morcerf
has decided today to leave the army

698
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,319
to dedicate his life to politics,
to the House of Lords.

699
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:17,917
The French army loses a great soldier,

700
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,958
but France gains a great man.

701
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,208
Fernand de Morcerf

702
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,750
fought at Moskova, at Leipzig,

703
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:26,917
in Turkey...

704
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,375
Everywhere, at the risk of his life,
he defended

705
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,811
a certain idea of the kingdom of France.

706
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:38,125
Fernand paid in flesh the price
of his commitment and the respect

707
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,625
of the word given.

708
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:43,125
Ten years ago, when France's ally

709
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:46,917
Ali Pasha of Janina
was besieged by Turkish troops,

710
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:50,625
Colonel de Morcerf went all in.

711
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,083
At the head of a squadron
of valiant soldiers,

712
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,125
he broke through the
back line of the Ottomans

713
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,708
And come to his ally's aid.

714
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,125
This act of insane courage

715
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:07,208
unfortunately wasn't enough,
but all the French know:

716
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,000
"You do not fight in hopes of success!

717
01:13:10,167 --> 01:13:14,125
"No! No, it is even more beautiful
when it is useless."

718
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:02,042
Is it better?

719
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:10,302
You haven't been very attentive
with Eugénie Danglars.

720
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,584
- Father.
- She will have 2 million as a dowry,

721
01:14:12,667 --> 01:14:14,167
the day of her wedding.

722
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,375
Fernand!

723
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:17,895
So I must pay attention to her fortune.

724
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:21,708
Better to have one less medal
and one more zero.

725
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:28,792
Our son is a man of his time.
He is a romantic who believes in...

726
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,500
Give the medal back!

727
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
There!

728
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,250
That's enough.

729
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:46,125
If I had known the honor of your visit,
I would have prepared for it.

730
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:51,875
If I had known the honor of your visit,
I would have prepared for it.

731
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:18,750
Get out!

732
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:25,000
Gentlemen...
If I had known the honor of your visit,

733
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:26,083
I would have prepared for it.

734
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:30,292
I apologize for welcoming you
into an improvised home.

735
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:33,000
I have only been in
France for a short time.

736
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,167
Count, I am sorry to intrude,

737
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,875
but we can never thank you enough.

738
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:42,500
I am certain
he would have done the same for me.

739
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,958
Count, I owe you my life.

740
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:49,500
I am glad to see you on your two feet.

741
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,513
I had it repaired, the stock was cracked.

742
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,208
It is yours now.

743
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:02,292
I thank you immensely,
but I cannot accept.

744
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,750
I already have a debt to you
that I do not know how to repay.

745
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:13,667
Do you like weapons?

746
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,333
Please.

747
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,675
This is one of my finest pieces.

748
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:37,917
Ottoman-style pistol.

749
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:42,083
Yes, but the iron guard
with engraved foliage

750
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,083
indicates that this barrel
is rather European-made.

751
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,792
From Venice, indeed.

752
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,833
You are a connoisseur.

753
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,853
My father fought against Sultan Khursit

754
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,177
alongside Ali Pasha.

755
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,708
Morcerf.

756
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,709
You are the famous General de Morcerf?

757
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:01,125
I am very impressed.

758
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,458
Would you try it?

759
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,667
Unfortunately,
I am expected at the Chamber.

760
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,292
- Another time.
- It won't take a moment.

761
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,583
You deserve your reputation,

762
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:40,750
General.

763
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:44,228
Let's change the target for you, Albert.

764
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,625
Remind me to never

765
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:57,417
challenge you to a duel.

766
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,042
Thank you for letting me have your son
for a few hours.

767
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:05,125
I look forward to learning more about the
one that providence has placed in my path.

768
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:07,750
I am participating in the hunt
of Baron Danglars on Sunday.

769
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,208
Join us.

770
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,708
I can't, I have to welcome
the son of Prince Cavalcanti.

771
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:17,292
Come both of you then.
There will be enough deer.

772
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:19,625
See you soon.

773
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,875
On Sunday, I hope.

774
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:26,020
Is everything alright?

775
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:33,125
I kept a little metal memento
from my Ottoman stay.

776
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:40,000
Do you prefer singing
to the music of weapons?

777
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:45,625
Follow me.

778
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,917
I beg your pardon.

779
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:57,292
I did not mean to disrespect
your... your wife.

780
01:24:58,292 --> 01:25:01,417
Haydée is not my wife.
She is my goddaughter.

781
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,417
After you.

782
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:05,208
Haydée.

783
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,083
What a wonderful name.

784
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:11,000
It is quite a common name in Greece.

785
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:15,792
It could be translated
as... modesty or... innocence.

786
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,208
May I ask you to introduce me to Haydée?

787
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:30,750
You seem to be a trustworthy young man.

788
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:34,800
So, I will introduce you to Haydée,
but you must make me a promise.

789
01:25:34,917 --> 01:25:36,447
I promise you in advance.

790
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:38,792
I am not joking.

791
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:43,417
Never seek to seduce her.

792
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:47,042
So you think me dangerous?

793
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,375
No.

794
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:50,542
But she is.

795
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:55,958
If you do not keep your promise,
she will break your heart

796
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,750
and her own.

797
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,458
- But...
- She is not yet ready to love.

798
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:05,042
The secret of her voice lies in her past.

799
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:09,750
After her father's assassination,
she was sold to a Wallachian tribe.

800
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:13,042
That is where I met her and took her in.

801
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:16,208
You know, there are sorrows and wounds

802
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:18,417
that take years to heal.

803
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,875
They leave a veil over the souls.

804
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,875
Never try to lift that veil, Albert.

805
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,542
I promise you.

806
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,208
Good.

807
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:38,000
You will walk softly,
without a glance at us.

808
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:40,638
You will only turn around when I call you.

809
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,083
Haydée.

810
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:51,388
Albert de Morcerf,
I present to you Haydée.

811
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,375
Delighted.

812
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,125
Delighted.

813
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,250
Delighted, miss.

814
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:01,712
And what if he doesn't try to meet me?

815
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:02,958
He will.

816
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,125
Stand tall!

817
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:08,542
Standing straight is surviving.

818
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:11,583
Hiding that you grew up in poverty,
is surviving.

819
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,792
Do you understand? Why, André?

820
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:17,792
Because I am Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

821
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:21,459
- Cavalcanti, doesn't that mean goat?
- What?

822
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:24,458
Don't look surprised.
Do you hear me say "what"?

823
01:27:24,625 --> 01:27:25,625
Start again.

824
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,625
I am Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

825
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:33,208
You don't have an accent, prince.
How come?

826
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,208
A very strict teacher
made me lose it with a stick.

827
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,708
Impertinence. Your elbows.

828
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,000
Dear count,

829
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:48,417
- I am pleased to meet you.
- Allow me a confession.

830
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:52,417
French life is still unknown to me,
I beg your pardon

831
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:55,875
if my manners seem
too Slavic, Neapolitan, or Arab.

832
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,208
Barking

833
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:35,250
Here is Count of Monte-Cristo
and Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

834
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:39,000
- Gentlemen.
- Count.

835
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:41,292
Prince.

836
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:45,167
The meeting with your father,
as overwhelming as it is,

837
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:48,917
must not divert you from your target:
Baron Danglars.

838
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:52,542
Thanks to stolen boats,
he made a fortune in slavery.

839
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:56,000
- Your reputation precedes you.
- Don't trust his smile.

840
01:28:56,167 --> 01:28:59,579
He is brutal. Not only is he aware of it,
he's proud of it.

841
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,375
May I confess something to you?

842
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:06,333
French life is still unknown to me,
I would ask you to excuse me

843
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,333
if my manners seem
too Slavic, Neapolitan, or Arab.

844
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,625
When one is rich,
one is never too anything.

845
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,125
His daughter is his weak point.

846
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,208
Prince.

847
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:18,750
Baron.

848
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:20,542
- Eugénie.
- Is the ground good?

849
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:23,042
- It's perfect.
- Then let's go.

850
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:25,079
On horseback, gentlemen.

851
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:00,792
Your honor, Count.

852
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,542
Thank you,

853
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,708
but I swore long ago

854
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,542
to only kill in self-defense.

855
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,708
Then let me take your defense.

856
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:13,958
Perfect.

857
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:16,083
Prince.

858
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,542
Please.

859
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:03,802
Let's go have lunch.

860
01:32:18,917 --> 01:32:19,917
Eugénie?

861
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:27,084
Thank you. Suzanne, I present to you
Prince Andrea Cavalcanti,

862
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:29,292
Monte-Cristo's Italian protégé.

863
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,792
He looks after me.

864
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:34,000
My father fears that the beauties of Paris
will lead me to make foolish decisions.

865
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,750
You speak perfect French.

866
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:40,500
A very strict teacher made me
lose my accent with a stick.

867
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:43,833
- But that's awful.
- That's false, mostly.

868
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,292
- My mother is French.
- What an idiot.

869
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:50,000
I'm glad you could join us.

870
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:52,792
Your protégé's hand didn't tremble.

871
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,584
The animal didn't even suffer.

872
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:57,844
And it's a specialist in executions
who speaks to you.

873
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,417
Do you often chop off heads?

874
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:03,334
Much less than before.
The trend is towards leniency.

875
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:08,167
Excuse me for stealing the Count away,
but I want to introduce him to someone.

876
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,469
- Count.
- Gentlemen.

877
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:30,500
Muffled conversation

878
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:34,417
Dear.

879
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,917
I finally introduce you
to Count of Monte-Cristo.

880
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:44,250
Madame de Morcerf. My respects.

881
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:49,846
Is everything all right?

882
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,583
Yes, it's...

883
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:59,000
It's the emotion of meeting the man
without whom I would be in tears.

884
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:03,375
Sir, I owe you my son's life,

885
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,417
and for this kindness, I bless you.

886
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:11,667
You reward me too generously
for a simple act.

887
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:15,333
But I am happy
to have spared you the sorrow.

888
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,084
I proposed to the Count to be our guest,

889
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:20,542
but he has so far refused.

890
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,625
Perhaps you will have better luck?

891
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:32,116
Will you do me the pleasure and honor
of being our guest one day?

892
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,375
Certainly, madam.

893
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:39,888
Permit me to take my leave.
I would hate to monopolize you.

894
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,167
But... what is happening?

895
01:34:56,542 --> 01:34:58,500
Would you like me to call someone?

896
01:34:58,583 --> 01:34:59,667
Albert.

897
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,591
What do you know about this man?

898
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Mother.

899
01:35:06,042 --> 01:35:09,125
You always distrust my new acquaintances,

900
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:11,125
but the Count saved my life.

901
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:12,917
He is as rich as a king.

902
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,500
What should I fear from him?

903
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:19,875
You are right.

904
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,083
My fears are foolish.

905
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:36,125
Mr. Attorney General,

906
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:39,750
it is on my honor, as a
lieutenant of the royal armies,

907
01:36:39,917 --> 01:36:42,625
that I attest here
that the named Edmond Dantès

908
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:45,675
has shown in my presence
and on numerous occasions

909
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:47,625
sympathy for the usurper

910
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:51,583
and his desire to take up arms
to overthrow the monarchy.

911
01:36:52,125 --> 01:36:54,875
These words weigh heavily on me
because Edmond Dantès was my friend,

912
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,750
but I cannot let this crime go unpunished.

913
01:36:57,917 --> 01:37:01,682
I have seen too many men die
because of traitors to the homeland.

914
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:04,250
That is not how you will find sleep.

915
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:06,250
I wasn't looking for it.

916
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:10,042
Do you fear your nightmares?

917
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,167
I fear not having them anymore.

918
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:19,583
They help me keep my wounds open.

919
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:25,763
Have you seen her again?

920
01:37:27,125 --> 01:37:28,125
Yes.

921
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:34,013
Was she as beautiful as in your memories?

922
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:40,375
I thought that grief
would have changed her.

923
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,542
It must have been short-lived.

924
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:50,811
Her eyes were not those
of a woman who has cried too much.

925
01:37:57,792 --> 01:38:01,675
She will find the taste for tears
when they take her husband away.

926
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,750
I'm passing.

927
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:32,792
200...

928
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:34,750
plus 500.

929
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,208
I fold.

930
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:40,787
I wouldn't invite you to my table
if you knew how to play.

931
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,792
There you go.

932
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:45,633
There are only three of us left.

933
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:49,083
I'll leave you two alone.

934
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:55,083
Two pairs.

935
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,500
Well done.

936
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:01,042
Color.

937
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,515
You have far too many hearts.

938
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:06,625
I'm fleeing before I ruin my father.

939
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:09,532
- Come on, let's go, Albert.
- Yes, that's right,

940
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:13,208
- go see those ladies.
- Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.

941
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:18,708
I like your prince very much.

942
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:19,875
He is charming.

943
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:24,375
I barely know him, to be honest.
His father is a business associate.

944
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:28,091
A good family, without a doubt.

945
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:32,875
If by "good," you mean "rich," then
yes, it's the second fortune of Italy.

946
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:34,042
Hm...

947
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,958
The second?

948
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:38,542
So you know the first?

949
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:40,787
Don't make me immodest.

950
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:43,792
Finally, people richer than me.

951
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:49,125
His family dreams of seeing him marry
a girl in Paris, but...

952
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:52,333
if the son is as fickle as the father,
beware.

953
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,208
Rest assured,

954
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:57,083
I distrust everyone in general.

955
01:39:57,833 --> 01:40:00,250
And foreigners, in particular.

956
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:03,263
I am a foreigner myself.

957
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,574
You, Count, that doesn't count.
You are a count.

958
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,917
And besides, it rhymes, you see?

959
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,917
You are a poet.

960
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,201
By the way, speaking of foreigners,

961
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:14,645
L'Impartial was bought by an Englishman.

962
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:15,833
Absolutely,

963
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:18,875
a certain Halifax.
A Lord, it seems.

964
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:23,792
He buys newspapers to spread false news

965
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:25,334
and speculate on the stock market.

966
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:27,375
He is a rogue of the worst kind.

967
01:40:28,792 --> 01:40:31,542
You don't seem to like
this Lord very much.

968
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:34,167
Let's just say I like many people,

969
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:37,000
but I only truly hate certain individuals.

970
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:40,542
Hating an Englishman is not a sin.
It's common sense.

971
01:40:44,792 --> 01:40:46,263
Are you leaving already?

972
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:50,113
It's almost midnight.
Our carriage will turn into a pumpkin.

973
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:56,417
Albert.

974
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,833
Miss.

975
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
You were about to forget your fan.

976
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:07,083
Thank you, sir.

977
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:14,583
- Can I count on you?
- For what?

978
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:16,917
To join me for dinner

979
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:20,554
that I am organizing soon in Paris.
I found a place to stay.

980
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:23,708
Well... Of course.

981
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:25,542
Good.

982
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:27,917
See you soon.

983
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:36,708
Count.

984
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,875
Madame de Morcerf.

985
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:43,209
You're leaving just as I arrive.

986
01:41:43,292 --> 01:41:44,822
Don't see any connection.

987
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:47,932
I wanted to apologize to you.

988
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:51,500
Apologize to me?

989
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,333
For my dizziness the other day.

990
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:59,042
You reminded me of someone
I once knew well who disappeared

991
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:00,917
under tragic circumstances.

992
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,792
For a moment, I...

993
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:16,542
It's happening again,
I can't find my words.

994
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:22,708
I'm sorry to have reminded you
of that painful memory.

995
01:42:25,667 --> 01:42:27,667
Rest assured, it has dissipated.

996
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:32,333
Good.

997
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:36,792
I wish you a good evening.

998
01:42:38,042 --> 01:42:39,208
Count.

999
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,083
Albert.

1000
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:07,625
"Haydée.

1001
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:11,458
"I'm not supposed to write to you.
So I won't write to you.

1002
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:14,708
"I must not meet you..."

1003
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:18,287
So I won't suggest
that we meet at the Jardin des Plantes,

1004
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:20,042
tomorrow at 5 o'clock.

1005
01:43:20,417 --> 01:43:22,750
This place, where I won't be tomorrow,

1006
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:25,500
holds the most mysterious flowers
of Paris.

1007
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:30,375
You come from a country nicknamed
the land of clouds and jasmine.

1008
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,750
We can count on the Parisian sky
for the clouds,

1009
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:35,792
I'll have jasmine in my buttonhole.

1010
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:38,208
So I won't say see you tomorrow.

1011
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,846
And I won't tell you that since I saw you,

1012
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,125
your voice and your face
have not left my mind.

1013
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:45,750
Albert.

1014
01:43:51,167 --> 01:43:52,875
Is he going to report us?

1015
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:54,866
He is very loyal to the Count,

1016
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:57,208
but he has a weakness for me.

1017
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:03,125
It's a strelitzia (Bird
of paradise flower).

1018
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:06,914
Where I come from, there were some
on a path leading to the sea.

1019
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:10,028
It's also called the bird of paradise,

1020
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,583
(In Romanian)
<i>bird of paradise</i>.

1021
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,708
(In Romanian)
<i>Bird of paradise?</i>

1022
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:16,375
Exactly.

1023
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:25,500
How is it that you don't have a fiancée?

1024
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:27,708
But maybe you do?

1025
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,868
My father wants me to
marry the daughter of a baron.

1026
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:33,417
But I...

1027
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:37,209
I'm looking for something
that this young lady will never have.

1028
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:42,875
That... indefinable charm that is to a
woman what fragrance is to a flower.

1029
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:46,458
Or what flavor is to fruit.

1030
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:50,250
I don't know if Parisian women
like to be picked or tasted,

1031
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:51,333
but not me.

1032
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,292
- That's not what I meant.
- I was teasing you.

1033
01:44:56,125 --> 01:44:58,831
Will you be at the Count's
dinner on Saturday?

1034
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,530
No. I will serve as
an alibi for my mother

1035
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:04,037
who avoids social events like the plague.

1036
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:05,333
And you?

1037
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:08,292
I don't know your mother,

1038
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,792
I don't know her tastes,

1039
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,804
but I share her dislikes.

1040
01:45:17,667 --> 01:45:20,609
Neither he nor his mother
will come to the dinner.

1041
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:23,657
But Fernand de Morcerf
will certainly be present.

1042
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:31,917
What's the matter?

1043
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:36,197
Are you not going to tell me about Albert?

1044
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,333
There's nothing to say.

1045
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:54,250
It's normal to doubt.

1046
01:45:56,208 --> 01:45:58,875
To be afraid. I understand that.

1047
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,339
But when the time comes,
you must remember...

1048
01:46:03,583 --> 01:46:04,875
I don't need you

1049
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:07,708
to remind me of what
his father did to mine.

1050
01:46:15,167 --> 01:46:17,167
He placed his lips there.

1051
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,333
Thank you,

1052
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,833
- my dear.
- Of course.

1053
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,958
Dear friends.

1054
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:55,750
Good evening, Victoria.

1055
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:02,128
I expected something more spectacular,

1056
01:47:02,292 --> 01:47:04,084
there's no need to make that face.

1057
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:06,667
There must be surprises inside.

1058
01:47:24,292 --> 01:47:25,625
Hm...

1059
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:33,250
You seem to have little appetite.

1060
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:36,508
I had an appetite before the pig
and the poultry.

1061
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:40,375
This house is... magnificent.

1062
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:43,042
I sense you are still surprised.

1063
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:45,042
Nothing escapes you.

1064
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:51,042
I thought a man like you
would choose a more central neighborhood,

1065
01:47:51,208 --> 01:47:54,667
like... the Champs-Élysées
or Saint-Germain.

1066
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:58,481
I bought this house precisely
because it was advised against.

1067
01:47:58,792 --> 01:47:59,792
Why?

1068
01:48:00,667 --> 01:48:03,667
Well, they say it's haunted.
Gasps from the guests

1069
01:48:03,833 --> 01:48:08,000
They say a crime occurred here...
an abominable one, years ago.

1070
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:10,875
Be careful,
we have the King's prosecutor here.

1071
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:11,958
It's true.

1072
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,971
A child was said to have been sacrificed.

1073
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:18,083
That's dreadful.

1074
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:21,417
You bought this house despite everything?

1075
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:22,917
You did well.

1076
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:25,917
These ghost stories are nonsense

1077
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,292
invented by malicious servants.

1078
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:29,903
Or jealous neighbors.

1079
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:32,449
Don't be mistaken, prosecutor.

1080
01:48:32,542 --> 01:48:35,000
I lived in Asia and the Indies,

1081
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,542
and it's hard to return
without knowing that there indeed exists

1082
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:40,917
a world...

1083
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,966
invisible, populated by spirits.

1084
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:47,417
When I visited this house, I...

1085
01:48:48,042 --> 01:48:49,542
I immediately knew...

1086
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:55,208
I had the strange conviction
that a crime had been committed here.

1087
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:57,875
So I asked

1088
01:48:58,042 --> 01:49:00,292
- to be left alone.
- But...

1089
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:01,667
were you not afraid?

1090
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,875
If your conscience is pure,
ghosts do not haunt you.

1091
01:49:06,042 --> 01:49:07,101
They speak to you.

1092
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:12,125
- And what did they tell you?
- But yes, what did they tell you?

1093
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:19,542
That night, I settled here.

1094
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:21,875
Right in front of this fireplace.

1095
01:49:23,542 --> 01:49:26,917
I smoked a bit of opium
to be more receptive.

1096
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:31,458
There's nothing like it to expand
the spectrum of your consciousness.

1097
01:49:34,042 --> 01:49:36,167
And in the sweetness of the smoke...

1098
01:49:38,292 --> 01:49:41,542
I felt as if... suspended.

1099
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:46,042
I hear a knock in the walls.

1100
01:49:47,542 --> 01:49:48,708
Then a second.

1101
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:53,792
I place my hand.

1102
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:58,625
And I hear screams coming from upstairs.
I go up the stairs.

1103
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:03,250
The screams turn into... moans.

1104
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,750
It comes from a room

1105
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:08,447
at the end of the hallway.

1106
01:50:10,333 --> 01:50:13,083
I push the door
and find myself in a bedroom.

1107
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,956
In the middle, there's a bed.

1108
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:16,628
I place my hand on it.

1109
01:50:19,833 --> 01:50:21,958
And I see a woman writhing in pain.

1110
01:50:22,542 --> 01:50:27,667
She is giving birth to a child.
She is alone, abandoned.

1111
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:28,958
She screams.

1112
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:34,458
And then I feel a presence behind me.

1113
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:36,250
All of a sudden.

1114
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:39,333
It knocks on the table.
Victoria screams.

1115
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,089
You frighten these ladies.

1116
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:42,750
And you entertain us.

1117
01:50:43,042 --> 01:50:44,958
Continue, I beg you.

1118
01:50:45,125 --> 01:50:47,750
Get a hold of yourself,
you're ruining the party.

1119
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:50,667
I turn around, trembling.

1120
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:53,583
And at that moment,

1121
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:56,792
I hear a whisper in my ear.

1122
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,083
It's the voice of a child.

1123
01:51:01,708 --> 01:51:03,459
The voice of a child begging me

1124
01:51:03,542 --> 01:51:04,667
to set him free.

1125
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,583
I finally find a door,

1126
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:11,583
a hidden door that I hadn't seen.

1127
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:13,667
I push it open.

1128
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,167
Stairs... They lead to the garden.

1129
01:51:18,333 --> 01:51:20,750
And the child's voice returned.

1130
01:51:20,917 --> 01:51:25,042
He told me he had been alone
for so long. He was crying.

1131
01:51:25,542 --> 01:51:26,954
He calls for his mother.

1132
01:51:32,083 --> 01:51:33,500
That night, I...

1133
01:51:34,417 --> 01:51:35,958
I searched, but...

1134
01:51:37,417 --> 01:51:39,208
the garden was too big.

1135
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,792
What... What did you do?

1136
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:53,208
Pardon?

1137
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,113
The garden was too big...

1138
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:58,333
What did you do?

1139
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:01,458
Yes.

1140
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:14,333
The next morning, we dug.

1141
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:16,042
Everywhere.

1142
01:52:16,792 --> 01:52:20,042
We uprooted the apple trees,
turned over the path...

1143
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:21,875
And nothing.

1144
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:27,458
So I had a truffle pig
brought in from Périgord.

1145
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:30,375
And then?

1146
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:35,319
Since it didn't find anything either,

1147
01:52:36,042 --> 01:52:37,667
we ate it that evening.

1148
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,750
Wonderful!

1149
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:44,375
I did say it was just a fable.

1150
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:47,167
A fable, exactly.

1151
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:51,000
At least, that's what I believed.
Until yesterday.

1152
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:54,167
While we were planting

1153
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:56,417
the torches for the reception,

1154
01:52:57,083 --> 01:52:59,167
one of them broke clean.

1155
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:03,000
We dug at that spot and...

1156
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:05,750
we discovered a chest.

1157
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:07,375
And then?

1158
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:10,833
What was inside?

1159
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:13,750
I don't know.

1160
01:53:13,917 --> 01:53:14,976
What do you mean?

1161
01:53:17,042 --> 01:53:19,542
I waited for you... to open it.

1162
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,750
And what if there's a body?

1163
01:53:40,167 --> 01:53:41,750
We will give it a burial.

1164
01:53:47,292 --> 01:53:49,167
Prosecutor, perhaps you'd like

1165
01:53:49,333 --> 01:53:50,333
to open it?

1166
01:53:54,042 --> 01:53:56,417
- I beg you, don't open it.
- Enough.

1167
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:20,958
Abracadabra!

1168
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,167
Oh, I don't know

1169
01:54:26,333 --> 01:54:29,292
what's true in this story,
but you are a magician,

1170
01:54:29,458 --> 01:54:30,708
count.

1171
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:39,861
How is it possible?
He spoke as if he had been present.

1172
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:43,375
All those details, it was...
I thought I was going crazy.

1173
01:54:43,458 --> 01:54:45,208
Calm down, please.

1174
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:47,834
- Where is our child's body?
- I don't know.

1175
01:54:47,917 --> 01:54:50,125
- You had placed it there, right?
- Yes.

1176
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:52,708
You told me he was dead!
You told me!

1177
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,500
Of course, he was dead.

1178
01:54:54,667 --> 01:54:57,000
- Then where is he?
- I don't know.

1179
01:54:57,167 --> 01:54:59,285
- Where is our child?
- I don't know!

1180
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:02,792
Be quiet, you are hysterical!
I don't know.

1181
01:55:02,958 --> 01:55:05,083
Calm down.

1182
01:55:06,917 --> 01:55:08,292
I know one thing.

1183
01:55:08,917 --> 01:55:10,565
It's that within eight days,

1184
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:13,079
I will know who this Mr. Monte-Cristo is,

1185
01:55:13,542 --> 01:55:16,417
where he comes from, where he's going,

1186
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:20,292
and why he speaks before us
of buried children.

1187
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:26,417
Danglars is obsessed with money.

1188
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,042
He won't be wary of someone

1189
01:55:28,125 --> 01:55:30,125
who asks for none.
Morcerf trusts me

1190
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:32,208
since I saved his son.

1191
01:55:32,375 --> 01:55:33,728
Then there's Villefort.

1192
01:55:33,917 --> 01:55:35,459
Villefort is the prosecutor.

1193
01:55:35,542 --> 01:55:36,583
He is suspicious.

1194
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:41,583
And thanks to this dinner,
Victoria will demand explanations.

1195
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,125
So to reassure her and reassure himself,

1196
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:46,234
he will conduct an investigation.

1197
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:50,250
And since we always learn more
from malicious tongues,

1198
01:55:50,417 --> 01:55:52,708
it's the count's enemy he will visit.

1199
01:55:53,333 --> 01:55:54,708
Lord Halifax.

1200
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,542
(English accent)
What do you want to know?

1201
01:55:57,625 --> 01:56:01,875
If I can harm him, it will be my pleasure.

1202
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,458
Has the count ever been to Paris?
He claims he hasn't.

1203
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:09,625
If he had already come, I would know.

1204
01:56:10,042 --> 01:56:13,917
But then, do you know
where he was 15 years ago?

1205
01:56:17,917 --> 01:56:18,750
But...

1206
01:56:18,917 --> 01:56:20,208
I must say,

1207
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,417
at that time, he still amused me.

1208
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,667
But after...

1209
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:29,958
After what?

1210
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:35,125
Well, one evening I
was correcting a servant

1211
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:37,125
who had it coming.

1212
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:39,125
But...

1213
01:56:39,667 --> 01:56:43,458
Monte-Cristo had taken a passion
for those savages,

1214
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:48,500
with their pagan gods, their absurd magic.

1215
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:50,167
Ridiculous beliefs.

1216
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:54,542
So he challenged me to a duel.

1217
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:56,667
For a native?

1218
01:56:56,833 --> 01:56:59,917
Yes! A native!

1219
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:01,708
Can you believe it?

1220
01:57:01,875 --> 01:57:03,958
Ah.

1221
01:57:04,583 --> 01:57:07,083
It's hot, don't you think?
What heat!

1222
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:10,125
Someone bring me my fan,
for heaven's sake!

1223
01:57:11,042 --> 01:57:12,708
We're suffocating in here!

1224
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:16,375
Not that one.

1225
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:18,083
Thank you.

1226
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:23,708
Hm. And you,

1227
01:57:24,833 --> 01:57:26,250
Mr. Villefort?

1228
01:57:27,292 --> 01:57:28,704
What has he done to you?

1229
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Nothing.

1230
01:57:31,375 --> 01:57:35,023
I don't know if I should count him
among my friends or enemies.

1231
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:39,542
If he were your enemy,
you would know already.

1232
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:43,750
He has flaws, but he's not
the type to hide his intentions.

1233
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:44,917
Hm.

1234
01:57:45,583 --> 01:57:46,583
But...

1235
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:48,583
be careful.

1236
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,000
Mr. Prosecutor.

1237
01:57:52,042 --> 01:57:54,208
If he becomes your friend,

1238
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:57,875
that will make you my enemy.

1239
01:57:59,708 --> 01:58:00,917
Of course.

1240
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:10,375
Yes.

1241
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:13,500
Thank you, Mr. Villefort,
it was very pleasant

1242
01:58:13,667 --> 01:58:16,583
to talk with you, but I have much to do.

1243
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,917
I thank you.

1244
01:58:19,292 --> 01:58:20,917
Mr. Prosecutor.

1245
01:58:30,208 --> 01:58:31,208
Victor.

1246
01:58:33,042 --> 01:58:34,042
Count?

1247
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:36,503
Prepare the horses, we are going back.

1248
01:58:47,542 --> 01:58:49,750
Now that Villefort has let his guard down,

1249
01:58:49,833 --> 01:58:52,167
we can prepare our attack.

1250
01:58:53,542 --> 01:58:54,917
I'm heading south.

1251
01:58:55,083 --> 01:58:58,848
I'll return for Danglars' party
for his daughter's 20th birthday.

1252
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,427
I'm counting on you,

1253
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:02,583
André, to get close to her.

1254
01:59:03,625 --> 01:59:06,333
And on you, Haydée, to enchant Albert.

1255
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,167
Go ahead.

1256
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:14,000
Good.

1257
01:59:14,167 --> 01:59:18,125
It can hold up to 600 slaves,
700 if pushed a bit, but...

1258
01:59:18,292 --> 01:59:20,083
I am a humanitarian.

1259
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,750
I named it Hercules.

1260
01:59:21,917 --> 01:59:26,458
My mother said that's the line
of people destined for great things.

1261
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:30,583
And this is your... love line.

1262
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:33,792
And here, I read that...

1263
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,542
I need to tell you something.

1264
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,500
Yes?

1265
01:59:47,542 --> 01:59:49,072
I would like to love you,

1266
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:52,125
- but I can't.
- I know.

1267
01:59:55,083 --> 01:59:56,208
You won't offer me

1268
01:59:56,375 --> 01:59:58,625
the feelings you have for Suzanne.

1269
01:59:58,792 --> 02:00:00,084
It will be our secret.

1270
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:02,833
It will be our secret.
It will be well kept.

1271
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,368
I know what it's like to be double.

1272
02:00:06,083 --> 02:00:08,201
I know what it's like to be double.

1273
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:11,167
Not being able to say who you are.

1274
02:00:13,375 --> 02:00:14,625
I will be your alibi.

1275
02:00:57,042 --> 02:00:59,278
The time has come to redeem yourself.

1276
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,042
I relive in dreams

1277
02:01:48,208 --> 02:01:50,503
every second of those moments with you.

1278
02:01:50,917 --> 02:01:53,859
I will carry into my night
the memory of your eyes,

1279
02:01:54,833 --> 02:01:56,709
and I don't want to speak to anyone

1280
02:01:56,792 --> 02:01:58,917
to not waste the echo of your words

1281
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:00,966
that still trembles in my heart.

1282
02:02:02,208 --> 02:02:04,458
I keep your score close to me.

1283
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:08,250
I love it for the image
it gives me of you,

1284
02:02:08,417 --> 02:02:12,208
but also and above all for the memory
it will forever hold,

1285
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:15,792
that of a moment of life
that is worth a whole lifetime.

1286
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,883
- See you later.
- See you later.

1287
02:03:07,292 --> 02:03:08,292
Prince.

1288
02:03:12,625 --> 02:03:16,084
Eugénie. This party is a
reflection of you, vibrant and joyful.

1289
02:03:16,167 --> 02:03:17,583
Thank you, Andrea.

1290
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:21,221
Will you count the Count of Monte Cristo
among your guests?

1291
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:22,750
17.

1292
02:03:23,208 --> 02:03:24,208
17?

1293
02:03:24,792 --> 02:03:27,209
You are the 17th to ask me that question.

1294
02:03:27,292 --> 02:03:29,250
And what do you answer everyone?

1295
02:03:29,708 --> 02:03:32,708
That there won't be an 18th. Here he is.

1296
02:03:37,292 --> 02:03:38,292
Excuse me.

1297
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:45,042
Miss.

1298
02:03:45,417 --> 02:03:48,375
- Count. Did you have a good trip?
- Wonderful.

1299
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:52,083
- Thank you.
- Eugénie is eager

1300
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:53,875
to see you again, miss.

1301
02:03:54,333 --> 02:03:55,917
Count, may I?

1302
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,042
With pleasure.

1303
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:08,958
Does the count know that we have met?

1304
02:04:09,417 --> 02:04:11,123
I haven't told him anything.

1305
02:04:12,167 --> 02:04:16,000
- Can he have guessed?
- God alone knows what he is capable of.

1306
02:04:17,917 --> 02:04:19,375
Aren't they beautiful?

1307
02:04:21,167 --> 02:04:23,292
They seem so eager to live.

1308
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,542
One is always eager to be happy.

1309
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,500
No?

1310
02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:34,458
Honor me with your arm.

1311
02:04:34,917 --> 02:04:36,583
I want to take a few steps.

1312
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:16,167
Your hand trembles.

1313
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:18,625
You seem cold.

1314
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:22,667
In my family,
we have cold hands but warm hearts.

1315
02:05:23,167 --> 02:05:25,833
Here. This will warm us.

1316
02:05:26,958 --> 02:05:29,000
Our grapes are not as good as in Sicily

1317
02:05:29,083 --> 02:05:32,000
but you will be indulgent
with our northern sun.

1318
02:05:32,292 --> 02:05:33,583
I regret.

1319
02:05:35,875 --> 02:05:38,042
I beg your pardon, but...

1320
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:40,250
I never drink.

1321
02:05:42,792 --> 02:05:44,734
Will you at least eat something?

1322
02:05:47,042 --> 02:05:49,000
I will have to decline again.

1323
02:05:50,875 --> 02:05:55,208
Mr. Count, there is an Arab custom
that makes friends eternally

1324
02:05:55,375 --> 02:05:58,670
those who have shared bread and salt
under the same roof.

1325
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:00,833
I know it, madam.

1326
02:06:01,667 --> 02:06:04,083
But we are in Paris and not in Tangier.

1327
02:06:05,042 --> 02:06:09,417
Here, there is no more eternal friendship
than sharing bread and salt.

1328
02:06:31,333 --> 02:06:34,458
But after all...
We are friends, aren't we?

1329
02:06:35,333 --> 02:06:36,583
Of course.

1330
02:06:37,542 --> 02:06:39,250
Why wouldn't we be?

1331
02:06:43,458 --> 02:06:48,375
So, in the absence of bread and salt,
share with me some memories.

1332
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:52,708
What would you like to know?

1333
02:06:55,208 --> 02:06:57,503
Is it true that you have seen so much,

1334
02:06:57,958 --> 02:06:59,375
traveled so much,

1335
02:06:59,625 --> 02:07:00,875
suffered so much?

1336
02:07:01,667 --> 02:07:03,333
What makes you say that?

1337
02:07:05,208 --> 02:07:06,292
Your eyes.

1338
02:07:09,125 --> 02:07:13,067
There is in every traveler the desire
to find or to flee something.

1339
02:07:15,667 --> 02:07:17,000
Did you find it?

1340
02:07:17,583 --> 02:07:19,407
I haven't finished my journey.

1341
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:26,083
Do you live alone?

1342
02:07:28,167 --> 02:07:31,292
I have neither sister,
nor son, nor father.

1343
02:07:35,375 --> 02:07:39,833
I only have Haydée
who, I am sure, will leave me soon.

1344
02:07:42,708 --> 02:07:44,833
How can you live like this,

1345
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:47,184
with nothing that ties you to life?

1346
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,000
I loved a young woman.

1347
02:07:55,958 --> 02:07:57,488
That I was going to marry.

1348
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:01,625
Years ago.

1349
02:08:02,125 --> 02:08:05,833
But when the war came
and took me far from her...

1350
02:08:10,042 --> 02:08:12,925
I thought she would love me enough
to wait for me.

1351
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:19,708
To remain faithful to me until the grave.

1352
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:25,042
But when I returned,

1353
02:08:26,083 --> 02:08:27,458
she was married.

1354
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:35,375
I may have had a heart weaker than others.

1355
02:08:37,708 --> 02:08:40,083
I suffered more than they would have.

1356
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,559
- That's all.
- That love has remained in your heart?

1357
02:08:47,875 --> 02:08:49,708
We truly love only once.

1358
02:08:51,125 --> 02:08:52,125
Don't we?

1359
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:56,208
Have you seen her again?

1360
02:09:00,708 --> 02:09:01,708
Never.

1361
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,000
Never?

1362
02:09:08,583 --> 02:09:09,708
Never.

1363
02:09:16,583 --> 02:09:19,292
Have you forgiven her for your suffering?

1364
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:24,875
One can only forgive
those who ask for forgiveness.

1365
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,030
And if she asked you for forgiveness
today?

1366
02:09:49,625 --> 02:09:52,917
Buy L'Impartial!
The Danglars fleet stolen in Marseille!

1367
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,500
L'Impartial, ladies and gentlemen!
L'Impartial!

1368
02:09:56,667 --> 02:09:57,667
Buy!

1369
02:09:57,833 --> 02:10:01,042
How can one steal ships
in a port in broad daylight?

1370
02:10:01,458 --> 02:10:03,084
They were insured, at least?

1371
02:10:03,167 --> 02:10:04,285
What do you think?

1372
02:10:04,625 --> 02:10:07,208
The Danglars stock is crashing.

1373
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:10,226
But thanks to the army's telegraph,

1374
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:15,417
Danglars will quickly learn
that nothing really happened.

1375
02:10:15,583 --> 02:10:17,667
You were supposed to steal his ships.

1376
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:19,750
Everything comes to those who wait.

1377
02:10:19,833 --> 02:10:22,542
You are safe. Your ships are fine.

1378
02:10:22,708 --> 02:10:24,250
- What?
- L'Impartial lied.

1379
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:29,000
"The Danglars fleet is still

1380
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:31,750
"afloat, moored in the port of Marseille"!

1381
02:10:33,583 --> 02:10:36,458
Thank you. Thank you, my friends.

1382
02:10:36,958 --> 02:10:39,834
Danglars will remember my words
and he will think...

1383
02:10:39,917 --> 02:10:42,792
That it's a blow from the new owner
of L'Impartial,

1384
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:44,417
our dear Lord Halifax.

1385
02:10:44,583 --> 02:10:45,583
Exactly.

1386
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:48,084
Monte-Cristo was right.

1387
02:10:48,167 --> 02:10:51,334
The Englishman uses his newspaper
to speculate at my expense.

1388
02:10:51,417 --> 02:10:53,123
We need to publish a denial.

1389
02:10:55,167 --> 02:10:56,167
Not at all.

1390
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,292
I don't understand. We must...

1391
02:10:58,375 --> 02:10:59,375
Shh!

1392
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:01,583
Do you hear?

1393
02:11:02,667 --> 02:11:03,667
Listen.

1394
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,292
The nice sound.

1395
02:11:08,292 --> 02:11:09,833
That nice little sound.

1396
02:11:11,458 --> 02:11:13,667
The sound of money falling.

1397
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:15,709
I don't understand either.

1398
02:11:15,792 --> 02:11:19,875
Think. He knows something
that no one knows yet.

1399
02:11:20,333 --> 02:11:24,542
Imagine: you're playing poker
and you know your opponent's hand.

1400
02:11:24,958 --> 02:11:26,958
- What do you do?
- I raise.

1401
02:11:27,125 --> 02:11:28,949
The stocks are at rock bottom.

1402
02:11:29,708 --> 02:11:34,458
If I buy them back now, in two days,
I'll make a huge profit.

1403
02:11:34,625 --> 02:11:35,958
My best move.

1404
02:11:36,125 --> 02:11:37,420
Buy back your shares?

1405
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:39,000
How much would that take?

1406
02:11:39,083 --> 02:11:40,500
- 500 million.
- 500 million?

1407
02:11:40,583 --> 02:11:43,833
500 million.
But it has to be done today.

1408
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,167
Before the market closes and before
that scoundrel Halifax does.

1409
02:11:48,542 --> 02:11:51,083
How do we find 500 million
by this evening?

1410
02:11:53,542 --> 02:11:56,837
By going to see the greatest enemy
of that Lord Halifax.

1411
02:12:24,833 --> 02:12:26,750
I'm sorry, Baron, but...

1412
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:29,753
the sea has always brought me bad luck.

1413
02:12:29,875 --> 02:12:31,581
I won't buy back your stocks.

1414
02:12:31,667 --> 02:12:33,750
- Count.
- However,

1415
02:12:33,917 --> 02:12:37,000
I never refuse to help a friend
and punish an enemy.

1416
02:12:37,167 --> 02:12:40,932
So I will lend you this money
and you can do as you wish with it.

1417
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,500
And I can guarantee you
an interest rate of 20%.

1418
02:12:47,958 --> 02:12:50,135
I will lend you money interest-free.

1419
02:12:52,167 --> 02:12:53,000
In Sicily, they say:

1420
02:12:53,167 --> 02:12:55,209
"You won't get rich
at the expense of a friend."

1421
02:12:55,292 --> 02:12:56,542
I insist.

1422
02:12:57,333 --> 02:13:01,250
I had a mortgage drawn up
on all my properties.

1423
02:13:01,417 --> 02:13:04,875
So, it's not for 500 million, but...

1424
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,000
200 million, I promise.

1425
02:13:07,375 --> 02:13:09,584
No, Baron, your word is enough for me.

1426
02:13:09,667 --> 02:13:11,042
In France, they say:

1427
02:13:11,208 --> 02:13:13,375
"Good accounts make good friends."

1428
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,559
Very well then. Out of friendship,
I accept your personal guarantees.

1429
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,125
In a week, I will have repaid you.

1430
02:13:26,458 --> 02:13:29,167
We will make that Halifax pay dearly.

1431
02:13:29,917 --> 02:13:31,417
A complaint is ready.

1432
02:13:32,042 --> 02:13:35,572
I will personally take charge
of the proceedings against him.

1433
02:13:35,708 --> 02:13:39,667
I can't wait to be in court
to witness this execution.

1434
02:14:01,792 --> 02:14:04,333
Lord Halifax, owner of L'Impartial,

1435
02:14:04,708 --> 02:14:06,583
called to the bar today

1436
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:09,250
to answer the charges of defamation,

1437
02:14:09,417 --> 02:14:11,667
had to leave the country in haste.

1438
02:14:13,667 --> 02:14:16,000
But he commits
to having his representative

1439
02:14:16,083 --> 02:14:18,375
before this court at 2 PM.

1440
02:14:45,292 --> 02:14:47,834
Mr. Judge, the comedy
has gone on long enough.

1441
02:14:47,917 --> 02:14:49,506
This is not the boulevards.

1442
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:55,708
I ask the representative
of Mr. Halifax to identify himself.

1443
02:15:03,792 --> 02:15:06,458
What are you doing? It's not over yet.

1444
02:15:23,583 --> 02:15:25,995
I am the representative of Lord Halifax.

1445
02:15:29,833 --> 02:15:31,208
I stand before you

1446
02:15:31,375 --> 02:15:35,208
because L'Impartial is accused
of spreading false news.

1447
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:37,458
But I assert here

1448
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:40,292
that the Danglars boats
have indeed disappeared.

1449
02:15:40,375 --> 02:15:42,708
Nonsense, my fleet is in Marseille!

1450
02:15:42,875 --> 02:15:44,000
This is a farce!

1451
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,584
- What proof do you have?
- You just need to

1452
02:15:48,667 --> 02:15:51,500
contact the port authority of Marseille.

1453
02:15:51,958 --> 02:15:55,250
So you persist in your claims?

1454
02:15:55,917 --> 02:15:59,708
I persist and I sign, Your Honor.

1455
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:02,795
But I want to do it under my real name.

1456
02:16:02,958 --> 02:16:04,458
You have a false one?

1457
02:16:08,042 --> 02:16:11,000
I am known
by the name of Andrea Cavalcanti.

1458
02:16:11,167 --> 02:16:14,708
After years on the streets,
I was taken in by a great

1459
02:16:14,875 --> 02:16:17,750
and wealthy family
of the Italian aristocracy.

1460
02:16:17,917 --> 02:16:19,667
I grew up as a thief

1461
02:16:20,042 --> 02:16:21,667
and ended up a prince.

1462
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:26,208
It's not a more honest profession,
but much more pleasant.

1463
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:33,000
It is here, in Paris,
that I finally found my real father.

1464
02:16:39,791 --> 02:16:42,416
I was born on November 3, 1815.

1465
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:46,750
In Auteuil.

1466
02:16:53,041 --> 02:16:54,666
Mr. Judge, could...

1467
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,875
the accused present evidence
for what he claims?

1468
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:02,666
I'm getting to that, Mr. Prosecutor.

1469
02:17:02,833 --> 02:17:05,083
Your patience will be rewarded.

1470
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:12,791
I am the bastard of a French aristocrat
and his mistress!

1471
02:17:17,125 --> 02:17:20,916
My mother does not know I am alive
because... my father

1472
02:17:21,083 --> 02:17:23,583
told her that I died at birth.

1473
02:17:25,125 --> 02:17:27,791
He wrapped me in cloth
and buried me alive.

1474
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:33,458
You speak, sir,
of an attempt at infanticide.

1475
02:17:35,125 --> 02:17:37,067
That's what should have happened

1476
02:17:37,583 --> 02:17:40,500
if my aunt had not dug me up.

1477
02:17:40,666 --> 02:17:42,291
Who do you accuse?

1478
02:17:43,291 --> 02:17:44,958
A respectable man...

1479
02:17:45,583 --> 02:17:46,916
whom you all know.

1480
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
His coat of arms is on this cloth.

1481
02:17:59,875 --> 02:18:01,000
My father...

1482
02:18:01,458 --> 02:18:04,083
is none other than the man before me.

1483
02:18:08,416 --> 02:18:10,000
Prosecutor Villefort.

1484
02:18:15,583 --> 02:18:16,583
Silence!

1485
02:18:16,916 --> 02:18:19,622
- Or I will have the room evacuated.
- Calumny!

1486
02:18:20,208 --> 02:18:21,333
I will sue you!

1487
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:23,083
Mr. Cavalcanti,

1488
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,958
do you understand the seriousness
of your accusations?

1489
02:18:27,041 --> 02:18:30,218
I will not settle for a cloth,
even stained with blood.

1490
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:34,291
Mr. Prosecutor will bring you
the proof of what I assert.

1491
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:38,541
- But you are delusional!
- Father.

1492
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:40,791
.

1493
02:18:40,958 --> 02:18:43,253
Do not force my mother to come testify.

1494
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:45,618
She has, I believe, suffered enough.

1495
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:58,250
The trial is suspended

1496
02:18:58,333 --> 02:19:01,208
for the duration of an inquiry.
Clear the room!

1497
02:19:03,166 --> 02:19:04,250
And one.

1498
02:19:06,625 --> 02:19:09,125
Come on, Victoria, let's go! Excuse me.

1499
02:19:09,875 --> 02:19:11,041
Let us pass.

1500
02:19:23,166 --> 02:19:25,250
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

1501
02:19:26,333 --> 02:19:29,583
Your father wanted me as a son-in-law,
but...

1502
02:19:30,583 --> 02:19:33,250
it cannot be, your mother is also mine.

1503
02:19:36,375 --> 02:19:38,140
Do not forget your life lines.

1504
02:19:38,666 --> 02:19:40,041
Be happy, my sister.

1505
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Count!

1506
02:19:58,292 --> 02:19:59,292
Count!

1507
02:20:00,958 --> 02:20:04,083
This story makes no sense.
We're swimming in madness.

1508
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:07,750
My boats were still in
Marseille yesterday. I...

1509
02:20:07,917 --> 02:20:12,125
I will need a...
a delay to pay you back.

1510
02:20:12,292 --> 02:20:14,208
If...

1511
02:20:15,667 --> 02:20:17,458
You have nothing left, Baron.

1512
02:20:18,042 --> 02:20:20,278
Everything that was yours is now mine.

1513
02:20:21,042 --> 02:20:24,542
The only thing you have left
are these clothes.

1514
02:20:26,083 --> 02:20:29,083
Leave Paris, and perhaps
I will not let your wife

1515
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:31,250
and your daughter starve.

1516
02:20:31,417 --> 02:20:33,042
But, Count, I...

1517
02:20:33,208 --> 02:20:35,625
Do you find me brutal, Baron?

1518
02:20:38,708 --> 02:20:40,542
"Not only do I know it,

1519
02:20:41,833 --> 02:20:43,245
but I take pride in it."

1520
02:20:57,083 --> 02:20:59,542
You should escort your wife home.

1521
02:21:00,042 --> 02:21:01,458
She looks quite pale.

1522
02:21:10,458 --> 02:21:11,500
And two.

1523
02:21:55,042 --> 02:21:56,042
Father!

1524
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:10,542
From Angèle.

1525
02:22:35,292 --> 02:22:36,292
Get away!

1526
02:22:36,792 --> 02:22:37,792
No!

1527
02:22:55,542 --> 02:22:56,667
Why?

1528
02:22:58,542 --> 02:22:59,542
Why?

1529
02:23:09,792 --> 02:23:11,000
Don't cry.

1530
02:24:30,167 --> 02:24:32,333
We knew it would end like this.

1531
02:24:33,292 --> 02:24:34,292
We knew.

1532
02:24:34,458 --> 02:24:35,458
Haydée!

1533
02:24:40,125 --> 02:24:41,542
He disobeyed.

1534
02:24:43,792 --> 02:24:45,250
Disobeyed?

1535
02:24:50,167 --> 02:24:51,833
Disobeyed what?

1536
02:24:54,792 --> 02:24:56,792
You taught him nothing but hatred.

1537
02:24:57,375 --> 02:24:59,750
You put this dagger in his hand.

1538
02:25:03,167 --> 02:25:05,500
It's your pain that speaks.

1539
02:25:08,333 --> 02:25:09,792
I loved him like a son.

1540
02:25:16,792 --> 02:25:18,375
Do you love me too?

1541
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:25,958
Do you also intend
to sacrifice me for your revenge?

1542
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,792
This is not revenge.

1543
02:25:30,167 --> 02:25:31,750
It's justice.

1544
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:40,875
Do not forget your tears, Haydée,
your mother's screams

1545
02:25:40,958 --> 02:25:42,792
and your father's blood.

1546
02:25:42,958 --> 02:25:45,429
And the name of the one who betrayed them.

1547
02:25:45,583 --> 02:25:47,125
Do not forget his name!

1548
02:26:18,583 --> 02:26:19,625
If you love me

1549
02:26:19,792 --> 02:26:22,625
as I love you,
do not seek to see me again.

1550
02:26:22,792 --> 02:26:25,334
You are too noble of heart
not to understand.

1551
02:26:25,417 --> 02:26:29,006
I keep my strength to fight
against myself and drink my tears.

1552
02:26:29,417 --> 02:26:32,583
Be happy far from me, you deserve it.

1553
02:26:40,917 --> 02:26:41,958
Albert?

1554
02:27:19,583 --> 02:27:20,583
Albert.

1555
02:27:21,708 --> 02:27:22,958
You are crazy.

1556
02:27:23,125 --> 02:27:24,500
You cannot stay.

1557
02:27:24,667 --> 02:27:27,334
Haydée,
I have only known you for a short time...

1558
02:27:27,417 --> 02:27:28,500
Leave.

1559
02:27:29,125 --> 02:27:31,714
Flee from me like one
flees from the plague.

1560
02:27:32,333 --> 02:27:35,216
- I will bring you misfortune.
- But flee with me.

1561
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:37,250
I swear to you, Haydée,

1562
02:27:37,875 --> 02:27:41,250
instead of despair,
it is happiness that I promise you.

1563
02:27:42,333 --> 02:27:45,917
You do not know me.
You do not know the Count.

1564
02:27:46,083 --> 02:27:47,083
Haydée...

1565
02:27:47,167 --> 02:27:49,050
If you love me as I love you...

1566
02:27:52,292 --> 02:27:53,750
Say goodbye to me.

1567
02:27:55,125 --> 02:27:56,333
I beg you.

1568
02:27:59,667 --> 02:28:00,667
Say it!

1569
02:28:06,292 --> 02:28:07,875
I will therefore tell you

1570
02:28:09,542 --> 02:28:12,660
testifying to God,
who reads the depths of my heart...

1571
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:18,833
I wish you a happy life without my memory.

1572
02:28:21,917 --> 02:28:23,167
Goodbye, my love.

1573
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,000
This look.

1574
02:28:30,083 --> 02:28:31,875
Without you, my life is lost.

1575
02:28:32,458 --> 02:28:33,811
My misfortune, certain.

1576
02:28:35,042 --> 02:28:36,292
What will you do?

1577
02:28:37,917 --> 02:28:40,583
But rest assured, I will keep my promise.

1578
02:28:41,292 --> 02:28:43,292
But please, will you live?

1579
02:28:44,042 --> 02:28:45,333
What do you care?

1580
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:49,633
In your eyes, I am already dead.

1581
02:28:58,333 --> 02:28:59,583
Let's flee.

1582
02:29:12,792 --> 02:29:13,792
Haydée.

1583
02:29:14,083 --> 02:29:16,667
If you wish to join the Morcerf family,

1584
02:29:17,208 --> 02:29:18,792
Albert deserves to know

1585
02:29:18,958 --> 02:29:20,083
your story.

1586
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,208
If you remain silent,
I will be forced to speak on your behalf.

1587
02:29:27,167 --> 02:29:28,750
Must I really speak

1588
02:29:28,917 --> 02:29:30,167
in your name?

1589
02:29:30,625 --> 02:29:32,542
Count, please.

1590
02:29:32,708 --> 02:29:34,238
Haydée is the daughter...

1591
02:29:34,333 --> 02:29:35,542
Stop!

1592
02:29:40,292 --> 02:29:41,625
I will speak.

1593
02:30:00,167 --> 02:30:03,958
My father was an illustrious man
known as Ali Tebelin.

1594
02:30:07,792 --> 02:30:09,083
Pasha of Janina.

1595
02:30:16,625 --> 02:30:17,958
I was 10 years old

1596
02:30:18,417 --> 02:30:21,182
when he was killed in front of
me and my mother.

1597
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:24,125
He had received a French soldier

1598
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,883
who was supposed to be our ally.

1599
02:30:28,625 --> 02:30:31,155
Even after being pieced
by a dozen bullets,

1600
02:30:32,292 --> 02:30:33,125
my father

1601
02:30:33,292 --> 02:30:35,792
still found the strength to attack

1602
02:30:37,542 --> 02:30:39,917
the man who had sold him out

1603
02:30:42,583 --> 02:30:44,407
by putting out one of his eyes.

1604
02:30:47,125 --> 02:30:48,833
I never saw my mother again.

1605
02:30:51,708 --> 02:30:53,792
That one-eyed officer sold me as a slave

1606
02:30:53,875 --> 02:30:55,792
to a Vlach tribe in the Balkans.

1607
02:30:57,042 --> 02:30:58,750
- His name was...
- That's enough.

1608
02:30:58,833 --> 02:30:59,917
Albert.

1609
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:08,125
- You manipulated me.
- I warned you.

1610
02:31:08,292 --> 02:31:11,542
- You used me.
- You might regret your words.

1611
02:31:11,708 --> 02:31:14,750
- You think you can scare me?
- Don't provoke me.

1612
02:31:14,917 --> 02:31:16,375
Albert, please.

1613
02:31:16,542 --> 02:31:17,542
Count!

1614
02:31:17,708 --> 02:31:21,826
You took everything from me.
Except my name, which you have tarnished.

1615
02:31:22,708 --> 02:31:23,708
No!

1616
02:31:24,292 --> 02:31:26,208
Oh, count, I beg you.

1617
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,083
I take your glove as thrown.

1618
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:32,133
I will return it
wrapped around a bullet tomorrow.

1619
02:31:40,458 --> 02:31:42,083
You have no mercy?

1620
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:44,625
Did they show any for Edmond Dantès?

1621
02:31:45,958 --> 02:31:47,042
Look at me.

1622
02:31:47,208 --> 02:31:51,458
I am nothing but the ars
of a deaf and blind fate.

1623
02:31:56,417 --> 02:31:59,542
Fernand de Morcerf will know
what my father knew.

1624
02:32:02,542 --> 02:32:04,292
If you kill Albert,

1625
02:32:05,125 --> 02:32:09,750
you will no longer be able to say:
"God is with me, for me."

1626
02:32:11,917 --> 02:32:13,583
You will be a murderer.

1627
02:32:17,417 --> 02:32:21,250
The Bible says that the sons will pay
for their fathers' crimes.

1628
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:30,333
Jacopo, follow her.

1629
02:33:10,958 --> 02:33:12,417
Leave us, Jacopo.

1630
02:33:14,583 --> 02:33:15,708
Madam.

1631
02:33:16,458 --> 02:33:17,875
What are you doing here?

1632
02:33:18,708 --> 02:33:20,708
Edmond, you will not kill my son.

1633
02:33:22,167 --> 02:33:23,708
What name did you utter?

1634
02:33:24,333 --> 02:33:25,333
Yours.

1635
02:33:26,875 --> 02:33:28,334
It's not Madame de Morcerf

1636
02:33:28,417 --> 02:33:30,459
who stands before you; it's Mercédès.

1637
02:33:30,542 --> 02:33:32,542
I don't know anyone by that name.

1638
02:33:35,333 --> 02:33:37,628
I recognized you as soon as I saw you.

1639
02:33:38,417 --> 02:33:40,959
And even without seeing you,
I would have recognized your voice.

1640
02:33:41,042 --> 02:33:45,125
My mind struggled, but my heart knew. Since
then, I've been following you, watching you,

1641
02:33:45,208 --> 02:33:47,125
I seek what you want at Morcerf.

1642
02:33:47,292 --> 02:33:49,625
Fernand, you mean, madam.

1643
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:52,750
Since we are recalling our first names.

1644
02:33:55,917 --> 02:33:57,292
The guilty one is me.

1645
02:33:59,292 --> 02:34:02,528
It is I who lacked strength
in the face of your absence.

1646
02:34:03,167 --> 02:34:05,792
It is I who lacked faith in your death.

1647
02:34:05,958 --> 02:34:09,625
- Me!
- Why? Why were you alone?

1648
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:13,250
Why was I absent?
Why was I arrested?

1649
02:34:13,833 --> 02:34:16,167
Why was I declared dead?

1650
02:34:16,333 --> 02:34:17,708
I don't know.

1651
02:34:21,583 --> 02:34:24,625
I imagine he no longer writes you
love letters,

1652
02:34:24,792 --> 02:34:27,500
but you will easily recognize
his handwriting.

1653
02:34:30,667 --> 02:34:31,667
Here.

1654
02:34:32,792 --> 02:34:34,417
Look, Mercédès.

1655
02:34:36,667 --> 02:34:38,542
Here is what your husband wrote

1656
02:34:38,708 --> 02:34:40,667
to Villefort twenty years ago.

1657
02:34:44,375 --> 02:34:48,375
I must take my revenge, Mercédès.
It is necessary.

1658
02:34:50,958 --> 02:34:52,841
Then take your revenge, Edmond.

1659
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,333
But on the guilty ones.

1660
02:34:58,958 --> 02:35:04,017
Revenge yourself on Fernand who betrayed you,
revenge yourself on me, but spare Albert.

1661
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:10,000
If you knew all the prayers...

1662
02:35:13,458 --> 02:35:16,042
If you knew all the tears I have shed...

1663
02:35:16,542 --> 02:35:19,167
Did you lose your father in solitude?

1664
02:35:19,333 --> 02:35:23,125
Did you see the one you loved
in the arms of your rival?

1665
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:27,333
- Did you see all of that?
- No.

1666
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:29,500
Yes.

1667
02:35:31,042 --> 02:35:33,984
But I see the man
whom I have never stopped loving

1668
02:35:34,208 --> 02:35:36,503
ready to become the murderer of my son.

1669
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:52,500
What do you want?

1670
02:35:56,042 --> 02:35:57,958
Do you want your son to live?

1671
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,333
He will live.

1672
02:36:04,333 --> 02:36:05,375
Thank you.

1673
02:36:07,125 --> 02:36:08,417
Thank you, Edmond.

1674
02:36:14,083 --> 02:36:15,667
I find you again.

1675
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:21,792
As I have always dreamed of you,
as I have always loved you.

1676
02:36:39,417 --> 02:36:41,208
We must say goodbye.

1677
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Goodbye?

1678
02:36:46,833 --> 02:36:49,657
If I renounce taking
justice into my own hands,

1679
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:52,167
I renounce what keeps me alive.

1680
02:36:55,917 --> 02:36:57,917
The duel will take place tomorrow.

1681
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:01,875
Goodbye, Mercédès.

1682
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:15,250
Mister Albert de Morcerf,

1683
02:37:15,583 --> 02:37:18,833
you have publicly challenged
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1684
02:37:19,458 --> 02:37:22,694
The duel will take place at twenty paces,
at my command.

1685
02:37:23,375 --> 02:37:24,875
Priority to the offended.

1686
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,583
Ready.

1687
02:37:34,292 --> 02:37:35,417
Go, gentlemen.

1688
02:37:58,375 --> 02:37:59,375
Fire!

1689
02:38:26,375 --> 02:38:27,375
Fire!

1690
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:15,167
I believe I see in your eyes
a glimmer of disappointment.

1691
02:39:17,125 --> 02:39:20,750
I will never forgive you
for taking his life

1692
02:39:21,792 --> 02:39:23,498
and for tearing my heart out.

1693
02:39:26,125 --> 02:39:27,542
So you loved him.

1694
02:39:28,792 --> 02:39:30,125
Did I love him?

1695
02:39:32,083 --> 02:39:36,042
Everything urged me to hate him,
but who knows why one falls in love?

1696
02:39:36,125 --> 02:39:39,833
You can try to reason with yourself,
but it's too late.

1697
02:39:40,250 --> 02:39:41,839
You have lost your balance.

1698
02:39:44,583 --> 02:39:48,042
Your secret voice whispers to you
that there is no more chance.

1699
02:39:48,125 --> 02:39:52,302
But instead of listening to that voice,
it was yours that I listened to.

1700
02:39:54,208 --> 02:39:56,856
I have brought about
his misfortune and mine!

1701
02:39:58,958 --> 02:40:02,667
What will I do with this love
that I did not give him?

1702
02:40:04,292 --> 02:40:07,042
With these words that
I did not say to him?

1703
02:40:09,333 --> 02:40:11,208
You said them to him.

1704
02:40:13,625 --> 02:40:14,917
And he heard them.

1705
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,583
Albert...

1706
02:40:39,208 --> 02:40:40,458
Count!

1707
02:40:47,875 --> 02:40:49,375
Run away, now.

1708
02:40:50,083 --> 02:40:53,083
Run away and do not let anyone
steal your happiness.

1709
02:41:32,792 --> 02:41:33,792
Edmond!

1710
02:41:40,042 --> 02:41:41,042
Edmond!

1711
02:41:46,667 --> 02:41:48,542
Edmond, show yourself!

1712
02:41:54,333 --> 02:41:55,708
I was waiting for you.

1713
02:41:56,833 --> 02:41:58,875
You finally show your true face.

1714
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,292
I sought to know yours.

1715
02:42:03,542 --> 02:42:04,875
To know who you were.

1716
02:42:06,625 --> 02:42:08,167
So I followed your traces.

1717
02:42:09,042 --> 02:42:10,958
I went everywhere you went.

1718
02:42:12,875 --> 02:42:14,583
I met them all:

1719
02:42:15,417 --> 02:42:18,792
your friends, your comrades-in-arms,
your enemies, all...

1720
02:42:20,167 --> 02:42:21,583
Who did you not betray?

1721
02:42:23,083 --> 02:42:25,142
To whom have you remained faithful?

1722
02:42:25,542 --> 02:42:27,833
Everywhere, you showed your true face.

1723
02:42:28,875 --> 02:42:29,625
I have lost

1724
02:42:29,792 --> 02:42:31,208
faith in Man,

1725
02:42:31,583 --> 02:42:33,333
the day you betrayed me.

1726
02:42:35,458 --> 02:42:37,047
You should have killed me.

1727
02:42:37,167 --> 02:42:38,625
It's never too late.

1728
02:46:38,500 --> 02:46:39,792
Get up.

1729
02:47:00,583 --> 02:47:01,833
Look at me.

1730
02:47:02,583 --> 02:47:03,708
Look at me!

1731
02:47:07,125 --> 02:47:08,125
Kill me.

1732
02:47:10,875 --> 02:47:13,111
We always find greatness in the dead.

1733
02:47:14,167 --> 02:47:15,875
In the end, we forgive them.

1734
02:47:21,833 --> 02:47:23,892
I don't want anyone to forgive you.

1735
02:48:36,375 --> 02:48:39,667
Mercédès, I came to say goodbye

1736
02:48:39,833 --> 02:48:41,875
where life tore us apart,

1737
02:48:42,042 --> 02:48:43,667
twenty-one years ago today.

1738
02:48:44,333 --> 02:48:48,000
So much has broken within me
and around me since then,

1739
02:48:48,167 --> 02:48:50,208
that the man you knew is no more.

1740
02:48:50,792 --> 02:48:53,083
I promised to love you until my death

1741
02:48:53,250 --> 02:48:54,917
and long after,

1742
02:48:55,417 --> 02:48:57,125
and I will always love you,

1743
02:48:57,292 --> 02:49:00,469
but it is no longer in my power
to bring you happiness.

1744
02:49:00,958 --> 02:49:03,500
I can only offer you consolation now.

1745
02:49:04,458 --> 02:49:06,292
Your son will be happy.

1746
02:49:06,708 --> 02:49:10,417
Albert and Haydée will live the story
that we could not live.

1747
02:49:10,583 --> 02:49:12,250
Happiness to our children

1748
02:49:12,625 --> 02:49:15,917
who will survive us
and taste the sweetness of love.

1749
02:49:17,417 --> 02:49:20,359
As I write to you,
I live my last moments with you.

1750
02:49:20,792 --> 02:49:23,833
Everything after will be just memories.

1751
02:49:24,458 --> 02:49:26,917
I will carry them with me across the sea,

1752
02:49:27,500 --> 02:49:30,209
the only place on earth
where everything is horizon

1753
02:49:30,292 --> 02:49:33,083
and where there are no traces left by men.

1754
02:49:34,333 --> 02:49:36,625
Live and be happy.

1755
02:49:37,333 --> 02:49:38,417
Never forget,

1756
02:49:38,583 --> 02:49:42,000
until the day when providence
may reunite us again,

1757
02:49:42,167 --> 02:49:45,285
that all human wisdom
is contained in these two words:

1758
02:49:45,667 --> 02:49:46,917
wait

1759
02:49:47,083 --> 02:49:48,417
and hope.

1760
02:49:50,625 --> 02:49:52,125
Edmond Dantès,

1761
02:49:52,292 --> 02:49:54,500
Count of Monte Cristo.
