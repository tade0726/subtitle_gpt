00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,500
1815 - Napoleon, driven from
power, has taken refuge on the island of Elba.

2
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,000
While his supporters
dream of his return,

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
the new royalist power hunts
them down mercilessly.

4
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Arrests and executions continue to spiral 
in a climate of civil war.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
On a stormy night off the coast
of Cape Corso (Corsica),

6
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,820
the merchant ship Pharaoh crosses 
paths with a boat in danger...

7
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,000
-You saved her.

8
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,875
Get me a blanket!

9
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,250
...

10
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,833
-I told you not to go!

11
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,833
You’re grounded!
I don’t want to see you until Marseille!

12
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,583
What?

13
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,625
Do you find me brutal?

14
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,333
Not only do I know it,
but I take pride in it.

15
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,042
Come on!

16
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,375
...

17
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,750
Come on, everyone to your stations!

18
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,625
Get her dry,
before she freezes to death.

19
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,792
Wait!

20
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:26,750
...

21
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:27,917
Come on!

22
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,250
...

23
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,208
Did you sleep well?

24
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,417
-You have something
that belongs to me.

25
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:14,625
-I had never seen
the Emperor's handwriting.

26
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,166
-Give me that letter back.

27
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,875
-I don't think so, no.

28
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,750
-What do you want?

29
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,875
-A good reason
not to report you.

30
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,500
Try money.

31
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,333
It often works.

32
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,583
-I don’t have any.

33
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,625
But I have friends.

34
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,833
If you talk about that letter,

35
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,958
they will find you
and they will kill you,

36
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,833
Captain Danglars.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
...

38
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,708
...

39
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,708
Sir?

40
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,500
I’ve caused you a lot of trouble.

41
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,333
I don’t know how to thank you.

42
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,917
-You just did.

43
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,750
Take care of yourself.

44
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,500
Miss...?

45
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,292
-Angèle.

46
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,833
-Edmond.

47
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,083
-I will never forget your courage.

48
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,792
But forget my name.

49
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,500
Goodbye, Edmond.

50
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,250
-Goodbye, Angèle.

51
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,042
...

52
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,917
-Morrel wants to see you.

53
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,917
...

54
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,875
-We had just changed shifts,
off the coast of Cap Corse.

55
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,917
The swell was strong.
We were 200 fathoms from the wreck.

56
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,708
-Give me the logbook.

57
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,917
-We were hitting the debris
when Dantès wanted to launch the lifeboat.

58
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,542
I forbade him. It was madness.

59
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,000
-Is that true?
-Yes, sir.

60
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,542
We would have done it for one of our men.
-It was my decision.

61
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,833
-I took my responsibilities.
-I ordered

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,667
to change course, and he dove.

63
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,458
-You dove?

64
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,417
-He didn't forbid diving.

65
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,708
-That's enough.

66
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,833
-Did you see that insolence?

67
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,125
Mr. Morrel, I tell you,
this boy is uncontrollable.

68
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,667
I don’t want to sail
with him anymore.

69
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,208
-You will no longer sail with him.
-I warned you.

70
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,500
-Because you will no longer sail
for me.

71
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:08,708
-Pardon?

72
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,625
-How could you let
her drown?

73
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,708
-I... I saved your cargo,
Mr. Morrel.

74
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,750
-Dantès saved my honor,
Danglars.

75
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,833
-Captain.
-You are no longer captain.

76
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,333
Go prepare your things.

77
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,458
I will arrange your pay.
-We don’t know who that woman is.

78
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,042
-I know what you did.
And that’s enough for me.

79
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,125
...

80
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,542
...

81
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,375
...

82
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,417
Kid, come here.

83
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,292
Come on!

84
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,208
Let this be a lesson to you.

85
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,667
Huh?

86
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,375
When you are a man,
you don’t hide behind your rank

87
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,958
or under a table.

88
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,792
I present to you

89
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,458
my grandson, Maximilien.

90
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,542
-Nice to meet you, Maximilien.

91
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,542
-Maximilien,
I present to you Captain Dantès.

92
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,875
-Good day, Captain.

93
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,333
-So, how old...

94
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,958
...

95
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,042
Captain?

96
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,333
-Yes, try to be worthy of it,
Edmond.

97
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,500
-Of course, sir.

98
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,500
Of course.

99
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,583
-Huh?

100
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,042
...

101
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,207
...

102
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:52,875
-That's good.

103
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,167
Edmond!

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,042
...

105
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,917
I can't believe it.

106
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,542
-I have to...
I have to tell you something.

107
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,875
-That you love me?

108
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,125
-Yes... that. But...

109
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,750
-No, there's no "but."
-Wait.

110
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,375
But I...
-You're starting again.

111
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,917
-You kiss a future captain.

112
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,000
-You're going to be...
-Yes.

113
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,958
-So we can...
-Yes. We can.

114
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,750
...

115
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375
I missed you.

116
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,458
I missed you. I missed you.

117
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,708
See you later.

118
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,125
...

119
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:28,292
...

120
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,167
-Edmond!

121
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,542
-Juliette. Are you well?
-And you?

122
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,708
-Yes.

123
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,708
How are you?
-It's Edmond, Louis's son.

124
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,542
-Good day, sir.
-Good day.

125
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,625
Where's father? I need to see him.
-At home.

126
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
-See you later.

127
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:13,833
You can smile,

128
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,917
it's good news.

129
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,000
You look serious.

130
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,958
-It's joy.

131
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,583
...

132
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,417
I'm so proud of you.

133
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:27,833
Captain.

134
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,625
-Captain.

135
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,458
-Did you inform Mr. and Mrs. de Morcerf?

136
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,458
-Not yet.
I wanted to tell you first.

137
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,292
Everything is going to change, father.

138
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,458
-We have to announce it to them.

139
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,750
This is all thanks to them.
-And to you, too.

140
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,583
-I didn't pay for your naval studies.

141
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,417
Come on, go, my son.

142
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,125
Go pay your respects.

143
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,542
...

144
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,208
-So, a toast! I raise my glass

145
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,042
to the memory of your mother, Edmond.

146
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,917
Because we miss her

147
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,000
and because she gave birth

148
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,125
to the youngest captain of Marseille!

149
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,333
-Bravo!
-Applaud him, he'll be embarrassed.

150
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,917
...

151
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,125
There you go, perfect.

152
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,417
But above all

153
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,333
because Mathilde Dantès

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,792
was the nurse
of a future peer of France

155
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,375
with a heroic destiny,

156
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,542
one of the finest officers in Europe,

157
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,542
I name Fernand de Morcerf,
at your service.

158
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,500
...

159
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,625
-Louis, come toast with us.
This is the occasion.

160
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,542
-Thank you, sir.

161
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
Maybe later.

162
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,208
-You can scold Mercédès.
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

163
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,583
-You'll see,
she'll be late for her wedding.

164
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
-Ah, finally!
-Ah.

165
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,250
-Excuse my delay,

166
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,333
aunt. Hello, uncle.

167
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,333
Horace de Balios

168
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,458
was being difficult.
I almost gave him a spanking.

169
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,083
-But really, Mercédès.

170
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,667
Who is this gentleman?

171
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,125
-He's a horse.
He's from a very good family.

172
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,875
-Hello, my cousin.
-Hello, my cousin.

173
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,167
Edmond.

174
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
-Mercédès.

175
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:29,292
-Are you ready to celebrate?
Edmond has great news.

176
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,750
-Yes, yes.

177
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,542
...

178
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,417
Yes, I'm going to be captain.

179
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,875
Captain of the Pharaon. It's official.

180
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,625
-Is that true?
-Hm.

181
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,708
-Bravo.
-To the captain!

182
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,708
...

183
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,333
-I got it!
-Ah! To your health!

184
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:11,542
I'm happy for you.
-Me too. I'm happy

185
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,583
for me. To yours.
-Are you going to get a new uniform?

186
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,000
He nods.

187
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,167
-And a new pay.

188
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,042
He'll be able to enjoy life,

189
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,750
have a good time.

190
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,000
We'll explain it to him.

191
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,708
-I'm going to be able to marry, especially.

192
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:27,958
-What?

193
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,833
-You will be my witness.

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,708
-Don't count on it!
-Well, yes!

195
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,125
-The witness to a waste!
Mercédès, say something.

196
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,417
-I tried, but he's madly in love.
-Ah, completely crazy.

197
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,500
-And her, does she know?
Finally, is she in agreement?

198
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,333
-Yes. From what she told me,

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,792
yes, yes.
-I know.

200
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,292
It's Juliette.

201
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,375
-Who?
-The maid with the mischievous look.

202
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,667
-No! No, it’s not Juliette.

203
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,417
No, she’s a real woman,

204
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,083
very beautiful.

205
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,958
-Not just beautiful.

206
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,625
-Hm.

207
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:09,208
-Mysterious and enchanting.
-Yes! No, no,

208
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,167
yes, yes.
-But who is it?

209
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,375
-It’s your cousin.

210
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,375
Mercédès Herrera de Morcerf.

211
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,292
-You?

212
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,375
-Yes.
-We’re getting married.

213
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,583
-But you’re completely crazy.

214
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,583
And your mother will never agree.

215
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
-You think mom
will refuse me anything?

216
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,875
Then you’ll convince her.
You’ve always been her favorite nephew.

217
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,917
...

218
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,625
...

219
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,417
...

220
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,833
...

221
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,542
...

222
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,750
...

223
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,791
-AMEN!

224
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,208
...

225
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
-I bring here,

226
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,583
signed by Mr. de Villefort,

227
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,958
the King’s prosecutor,

228
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,792
an arrest warrant
for the named Edmond Dantès.

229
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,833
...

230
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,792
-Follow us.

231
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,000
-What’s happening?

232
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,750
No, let him be.
-There must be an explanation.

233
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,625
-Come.
-Let me go.

234
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,917
-Wait.
-Fernand, do something!

235
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,458
-What’s wrong? My son hasn’t done anything.

236
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,833
-It’s definitely a misunderstanding.

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,042
-Where are you taking him?
I’ll go with you.

238
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,750
-We must take him alone, sir.
-Lieutenant.

239
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,542
Lieutenant Fernand de Morcerf.

240
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,125
-Tell your friends
to let us through.

241
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,792
It’s a royal order.

242
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,125
...

243
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,333
-I'll take care of it.

244
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,333
-Please follow us now.
-Edmond!

245
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,333
-I’ll be back, my love.

246
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,208
...

247
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,417
...

248
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,667
-Edmond Dantès, Mr. Prosecutor.

249
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,958
-Let us be.

250
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,333
I have always admired sailors
like you, Mr. Dantès.

251
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,625
I only fear the sea.

252
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,458
It's true, this endless abyss.

253
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,500
These black waters.

254
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,125
A monster always seems ready to emerge
to devour you.

255
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:29,667
-What am I being accused of?
Why am I being arrested on my wedding day?

256
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,083
-Do you have an enemy, Mr. Dantès?

257
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,167
-An... an enemy?

258
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,042
-Or a jealous one.

259
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:43,458
You’ve just been named captain,
you’re going to marry a fine match...

260
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,792
You may have made some envious.

261
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,417
-I don’t know, no.

262
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,625
I had a disagreement recently
with a crew member,

263
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,500
but what could he accuse me of?

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,167
-I don’t know.

265
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,875
Of being a Bonapartist agent,
for example.

266
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,333
-Excuse me?

267
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,417
But... that makes no sense.

268
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,125
-We found this Bible
in your cabin.

269
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,000
Is this your Bible?

270
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,542
Your name is written in it.

271
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,875
-Yes, but that’s not a crime.

272
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,458
-That’s true.

273
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,833
But we also found
inside an order of mission

274
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,083
signed by Napoleon himself.

275
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,417
And that is a crime.

276
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,958
-Wait.

277
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,750
No, this is the first time
I've seen this letter.

278
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,542
-If you have no enemy,
who could have slipped it in there?

279
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,042
-Off the coast of Cap Corse,
I saved a young woman from drowning.

280
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,833
-Did she thank you
in your cabin?

281
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,833
-No.

282
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Danglars locked her up there.
She left in Marseille.

283
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,458
You can check.

284
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,667
Ask Quartermaster
Gaspard Caderousse.

285
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,083
-Caderousse?
-Yes.

286
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,125
-What do you know about her?

287
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:12,542
-Nothing.

288
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,250
-Mr. Dantès.

289
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,208
I’ve interrogated
dozens of conspirators

290
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,333
and I believe you’re not one of them.

291
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,833
I’m willing to help a friend of the Morcerfs,

292
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,292
but I need you to help me.

293
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,917
-I swear to you
I know nothing about her.

294
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,542
She told me her name was Angèle.

295
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,667
That’s all.

296
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,542
-Did you...

297
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,708
reveal the name of this young woman
to anyone?

298
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,125
-No.

299
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,625
...

300
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,583
-Not even to that Caderousse?

301
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,125
-No.

302
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,625
To no one. I swear.

303
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,167
-Well, you see, Mr. Dantès,
I believe you.

304
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:07,250
However, I’m going to have to
keep you a bit longer,

305
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,708
until I can interrogate
the rest of the crew.

306
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,958
If they confirm your testimony,
which I have no doubt they will,

307
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,292
I will return you to your fiancée,
who will have plenty of time to hate me.

308
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,583
-Count on her.

309
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,125
...

310
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,875
-Fernand will bring you back.

311
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,083
-I can't take it anymore, I'm going.

312
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,750
-You can't do anything more.

313
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,167
-It would suit you
if they didn't release him.

314
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,208
-How can you say
such horrors?

315
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,500
-Gerard, whatever you’ve been told about Dantès,
I stand by him.

316
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,750
-Let us be alone for a moment, gentlemen.

317
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,667
Fernand, I’m sorry for your friend.

318
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,750
I know your ties.

319
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,833
But you don't know everything.

320
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,000
We found an order of mission from the Emperor on him.

321
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,792
And his crew members claim
he is one of his supporters.

322
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,333
I think you understand
the seriousness of these accusations.

323
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,375
He was arrested
before he could marry Mercédès

324
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,792
and before the irreparable was committed,

325
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,833
but if you are willing to vouch for him,

326
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,125
if you think
these two men are lying...

327
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,917
If you are ready to take that risk,

328
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,875
then I will free him.

329
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,458
You only need to say one word.

330
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,375
-No.

331
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,708
-No?

332
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,583
-He does not deserve...

333
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,083
-He does not deserve what?

334
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,458
-For our family name
to be sullied.

335
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,208
If Dantès has betrayed us,

336
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,542
he should suffer the fate of traitors.

337
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,375
-I can ensure...

338
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,667
that no trial
will tarnish the reputation of the Morcerfs.

339
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,042
I will need
your testimony.

340
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,958
...

341
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,000
-Do you understand what is happening?

342
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,458
Then keep your mouth shut.

343
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,708
...

344
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:35,750
-Mr. Dantès?
-Did you get to speak to the prosecutor?

345
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,542
-Yes, sir.

346
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,125
-This is a day I will never forget.

347
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,250
Aren't you taking me home?

348
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,042
-No, indeed.

349
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,458
Go.

350
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,167
...

351
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,083
-What’s happening? What’s happening?

352
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,083
Let me go.

353
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,875
Call the prosecutor.
I spoke with the prosecutor!

354
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,125
Call him. Call him!

355
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,833
I’m innocent! I did nothing!
Let me go.

356
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,875
...

357
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,708
...

358
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,375
-Shh, shh, shh.

359
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,542
...

360
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,292
If you were guilty, they would have hanged you.
They’re taking you away,

361
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,250
because you know things
that they don’t want to hear.

362
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,708
Come on.

363
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,750
-Stop.

364
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,917
Stop!

365
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,917
...

366
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,542
Let me go!

367
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,833
-Where is he?

368
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,750
-I couldn’t do anything.

369
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:17,417
...

370
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,583
Mercédès.

371
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,375
-Let me be.

372
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,333
-It wouldn’t help.

373
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,833
Mercédès...
-Stop.

374
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,125
-Please.

375
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
...

376
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,375
-What’s going on, Victoria?

377
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,833
Aren’t you happy to see me?
-Your sister is here.

378
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,000
...

379
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,542
-Mademoiselle de Villefort.

380
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,625
You wear your secrets well.

381
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,375
-Sorry I can’t return the compliment.

382
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,583
-Cognac?
Sorry, I'm all out of seawater.

383
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,125
Yes, it’s my job to know everything.

384
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,750
-So you know
that Dantès is innocent.

385
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,625
-Innocent... Yeah.

386
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,750
But who is truly innocent?

387
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:44,042
-He did nothing.
Why did you arrest him?

388
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,667
-In order to save your life.

389
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,042
-My life or your reputation?

390
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,083
...

391
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,458
-We’re both playing politics.

392
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,333
In politics,
you don’t eliminate a man,

393
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,083
you eliminate an obstacle.

394
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,208
-I knew you practiced your profession
with cruelty,

395
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,958
but I had hoped
you at least did it honestly.

396
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,292
-Why don’t you confess
in his place?

397
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,917
-But I will, Gérard.

398
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,458
If you refuse to save him,
I will do it.

399
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,708
But you would prefer
that my existence be ignored,

400
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,625
as well as that of Victoria,

401
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,292
your mistress,

402
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,208
and your future child.

403
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,292
...

404
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,833
Just as I thought.

405
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,917
...

406
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,870
CHATEAU D'IF PRISON
FOUR YEARS LATER

407
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:03,833
...

408
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,083
-Alive?

409
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,750
-Alive.

410
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,125
...

411
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,667
-Alive?

412
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,708
-Alive!

413
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,125
...

414
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,292
-Alive?

415
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,625
-Alive.

416
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:13,458
...

417
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,125
...

418
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,792
...

419
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:37,167
...

420
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:40,917
...

421
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:53,250
...

422
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,792
...

423
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,875
-Take wide...
Stay clear of the coast...

424
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:05,208
And who knows the way...
Who knows exactly...

425
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,208
...

426
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:19,833
...

427
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:23,875
...

428
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,208
...

429
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:32,333
...

430
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,167
...

431
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,250
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

432
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,875
...

433
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,250
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

434
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,125
Is anyone there?

435
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,625
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

436
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:24,042
...

437
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,333
Is anyone there?

438
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,625
-Who are you?

439
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,250
-Uh, I... Dantès, Edmond Dantès.

440
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,750
-How old are you?

441
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,708
Your voice sounds like a young man’s.
-I’m...

442
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,583
...

443
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,500
I don’t know anymore.

444
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:57,208
I was 22...
when they imprisoned me.

445
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,542
On May 16, 1815.

446
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,542
-That was four years ago.

447
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,958
You are 26 years old.

448
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,625
-Four years?

449
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,542
And...

450
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,250
And you, who are you?

451
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,542
-A prisoner.

452
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,333
Like you.

453
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,625
-For how long?

454
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,708
-Shh!

455
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,792
-What?

456
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,375
-They’re coming.
-Wait.

457
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,417
Don’t leave me.

458
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,750
Who are you?
At least tell me your name.

459
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,125
Your name!

460
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:42,083
...

461
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,333
...

462
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,083
-34! Alive?

463
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,167
...

464
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,167
-Alive.

465
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,375
...

466
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,667
...

467
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:41,583
...

468
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,875
...

469
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:56,167
...

470
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,958
...

471
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,208
-I was waiting for you.

472
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,542
...

473
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,833
...

474
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,708
-Do you really think
you can get out of here?

475
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,750
-I’ve dug 30 meters in six years.

476
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,042
To go around your cell
and reach the outside,

477
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,375
it will take twice as long.

478
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,250
-12 years?

479
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:32,417
-Maybe a little less,
now that we’ll be two.

480
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,875
Why? Do you have other plans?

481
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,417
-No.

482
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,083
-I am Abbé Faria.

483
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,875
...

484
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,083
-Edmond Dantès.

485
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,542
...

486
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,458
...

487
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,833
...

488
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,167
-Had you ever seen this letter?

489
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,208
-No, never.

490
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:25,667
...

491
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,292
And you?
Do you know why you are here?

492
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,375
-Yes.

493
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:40,083
They wanted to silence you.
They wanted to make me talk.

494
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,458
<i>He speaks in Italian.</i>

495
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,708
I choose the people
I confide in.

496
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,917
You don’t know Italian?

497
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,333
-No.
-English, Arabic, Latin, Greek?

498
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,417
-I only know the sea.

499
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,458
-If you want, I’ll teach you.

500
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,750
With patience
and will, in...

501
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,792
in 6 or 7 years,
you will know everything I know.

502
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:18,542
...

503
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,958
History, philosophy,

504
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,708
mathematics.

505
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,583
These are...

506
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,292
These are weapons

507
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,083
that free just as much as this one.

508
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,250
...

509
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,417
-Hm.

510
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,333
...

511
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,333
...

512
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,917
...

513
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,417
...

514
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,458
...

515
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:33,292
...

516
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,375
-What is the first thing you will do

517
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,333
if we manage to get out?

518
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,333
-I will find Mercédès.

519
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,208
-What will you do
if she hasn’t waited for you?

520
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,208
-Then I will have nothing left.

521
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,500
-I will tell you a story, Edmond.

522
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,333
...

523
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,042
Seven hundred years ago,

524
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,042
in Jerusalem,
during the First Crusade,

525
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,750
the knights

526
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:11,458
charged with protecting the tomb of Christ
create the Order of the Templars.

527
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:13,750
On the first day,

528
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:17,542
they are just a few,
but they have immense faith.

529
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,458
Thanks to their victories,

530
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,667
the order amasses a fortune...

531
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,000
considerable.

532
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:31,333
Consi... Considerable.

533
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:36,875
I’m talking about the greatest treasure
the Earth has ever known.

534
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:39,125
And...

535
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,375
over time,

536
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,167
their power, their wealth,
makes them envied.

537
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:51,875
And on Friday, October 13, 1307,
the King of France, Philip the Fair,

538
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,000
orders their arrest

539
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,875
and the seizure of their goods.

540
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,375
But no one
ever found the treasure.

541
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,625
...

542
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,708
Do you know...

543
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,292
what these knights did
with this immense fortune?

544
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,458
-No.
-Nothing!

545
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,208
Edmond, nothing.

546
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,750
Too busy seeking revenge,

547
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,375
punishing those who had betrayed them,

548
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,042
they died one after the other.

549
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,250
At least, almost all of them.

550
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,292
The last of them

551
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,708
was Cardinal Spada.

552
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:45,083
At the end of his life,
sheltered on the island of Monte-Cristo,

553
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,542
he had time
to train one last knight.

554
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,292
This young man was called...

555
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,583
Giuseppe Faria.

556
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,500
I am the last survivor, Edmond.

557
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,208
And I know

558
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,250
where the treasure is.

559
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:10,875
Half of which

560
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,250
belongs to you today.

561
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,083
But what will you do with this fortune?

562
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,667
...

563
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,375
Will you do good

564
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:26,792
or will you let your heart
fill with hatred?

565
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:40,500
10 YEARS LATER

566
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,500
-I’m going to empty the bag.

567
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,000
-Edmond.

568
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,125
-Huh?

569
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,042
...

570
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,250
-It’s salty.

571
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,167
The water, it’s salty.

572
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:38,042
We’re almost there.
It’s a matter of days.

573
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,083
...

574
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:46,792
-We’re there, we’re there.

575
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,333
...

576
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,250
I’ll be right back.

577
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,792
...

578
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,667
...

579
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,625
Step back!

580
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,667
...

581
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,000
Abbé?!

582
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,250
Abbé! Abbé!

583
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:14,833
...

584
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,500
...

585
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:29,167
...

586
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,500
...

587
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,583
Here.

588
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,250
-Edmond.
-No, no, don’t talk.

589
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,333
I’m going to call for help.

590
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
-No.

591
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:42,750
(In Italian)
It’s too late.

592
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,833
Don’t be sad.

593
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,833
...

594
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:53,792
You have been the only comfort
of my life.

595
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,667
The Lord gave it to me...

596
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,750
a little late, but he gave it to me.

597
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:03,583
...

598
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:06,583
I am not mad, Edmond.

599
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,667
-I know.

600
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:12,167
-The treasure exists.

601
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,375
You know where to find it.

602
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,667
-We will go look for it together!

603
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,083
-Don't forget.

604
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,625
Monte-Cristo.

605
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,542
Monte-Cristo.

606
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:28,958
Mount...

607
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,000
...

608
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:31,792
...

609
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,458
...

610
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,625
...

611
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,208
Don't leave me.

612
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,042
Don't leave me. Huh?

613
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,583
Don't leave me.

614
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,792
...

615
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,417
-Alive?

616
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:05,792
-Alive!

617
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,833
...

618
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,167
-Alive?

619
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,375
Number 17?

620
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,750
Oh, 17!

621
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,792
...

622
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
...

623
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,208
Oh, Abbé?

624
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:26,750
Oh! He is dead, throw the sack!

625
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:53,458
...

626
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,500
...

627
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,125
-Which one is it?

628
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,458
-Abbé

629
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,708
...

630
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,875
-Alive?

631
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
-Alive!

632
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,792
-Alive?

633
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,250
...

634
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,542
-Alive?

635
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,167
...

636
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,958
...

637
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:44,917
Stand up.

638
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,125
Stand up!

639
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,333
I said stand up!

640
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,542
...

641
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,833
Alert!

642
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:01,625
-ONE...

643
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,583
-Alert!

644
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,208
-TWO...

645
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,708
-Alert!

646
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:08,375
-AND THREE!

647
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:21,625
...

648
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,292
...

649
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,042
...

650
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:05,958
...

651
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,958
...

652
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,708
...

653
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:18,292
...

654
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:54,125
...

655
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,750
...

656
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,708
-Hey! You shouldn't be here.

657
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:33,875
Go away!

658
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:37,417
-I came to see Louis. Louis Dantès.

659
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,333
-Did you know Louis?

660
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,917
-Yes.

661
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,708
-We buried that poor Louis.

662
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,333
A long time ago.

663
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,417
...

664
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,083
-No, that can't be true.

665
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,125
-He let himself die of hunger
after his son's death.

666
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,000
He wanted to join him.

667
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,292
-But his...

668
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,333
But his son is not dead.

669
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,333
-I'm sorry.

670
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,875
...

671
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,750
You were a sailor too?

672
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,417
-Yes.
-Hm.

673
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:24,458
I will give you something to eat.
But then you disappear, okay?

674
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:33,000
-And Mercé... Mercédès?

675
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,583
And Fernand de Morcerf?

676
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,542
-They haven't come by in 7 or 8 years.

677
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,875
They have been living in Paris
since the birth of their son.

678
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,083
You are too late.

679
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,917
-Avoid the Ligurian Sea

680
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,000
and its endless patrols.

681
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,458
Set course for Sardinia.

682
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,583
You can stop at Santa Teresa di Gallura.

683
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:59,833
The island of Monte-Cristo is

684
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,417
to the west of the Tuscan Archipelago.

685
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,917
...

686
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:25,458
You will dock at the southern tip.

687
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:30,333
I know you will be overwhelmed
by its austere beauty.

688
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,750
I envy you for discovering it
for the first time.

689
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,208
There.

690
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:39,833
That's it.

691
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,292
The tomb of the illustrious Spada family.

692
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,167
The rest, Edmond,

693
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:48,708
is your story.

694
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:54,542
The story of a man who holds the world

695
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:57,167
in the palm of his hand.

696
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:13,625
...

697
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:51,250
...

698
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,125
...

699
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,333
...

700
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,208
...

701
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:25,000
MARSEILLE
ONE YEAR LATER

702
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:43,083
-I beg you, go ahead.
-Stop.

703
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,167
-I'll pay you tomorrow.
-No, no. Gaspard, get out.

704
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,667
-M. Caderousse is my friend.

705
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:03,458
On his deathbed, Edmond Dantès
asked me to share with those

706
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:06,125
who mattered to him.

707
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:12,625
He thought he had been betrayed
by a certain Danglars.

708
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:18,167
But he was convinced that two men
had remained loyal to him.

709
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:19,583
He told me:

710
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,375
"One is named Gaspard Caderousse,

711
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:26,292
"and the second, Fernand de Morcerf."

712
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,542
-Keep your diamond.

713
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,917
None of us deserves
anything.

714
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,125
-Wait, my son.

715
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:38,042
-If I reveal what I know,
they will know it came from me.

716
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,542
And these people
are rich and powerful.

717
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,792
-You have nothing to fear,

718
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:46,042
I am bound
by the secret of confession.

719
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,583
Have a seat.

720
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,292
...

721
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:56,208
...

722
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,958
-Dantès was right about Danglars.
He is the one who betrayed him.

723
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:06,542
-But Fernand de Morcerf?
He was his friend.

724
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:07,833
...

725
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,125
-Can one be a friend
to someone whose woman one covets?

726
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:14,250
Out of love for Mercédès,

727
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,417
he sacrificed Edmond.

728
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,917
...

729
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:25,958
-He will live.
But to everyone, he will be dead.

730
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,000
-Hm.

731
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:33,417
-The only one who would have deserved
Dantès' affection is Morrel.

732
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,375
-The shipowner?

733
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,417
-He fought to free him.

734
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:43,292
And he too,
providence has rewarded him little.

735
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:46,083
After Dantès' arrest,

736
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,833
he had to take Danglars back
as captain.

737
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,250
But Danglars betrayed him too.

738
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:54,208
He made half of his fleet disappear,

739
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,458
allegedly stolen by pirates.

740
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,875
Ruined, Morrel had to sell the company.

741
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,375
And guess who bought it
for a pittance?

742
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,833
-Danglars.

743
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:10,042
-Two months later,
the ships reappeared.

744
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,375
But the prosecutor Villefort
didn't budge.

745
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,500
To be fair, they shared a secret.

746
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,708
Little Victoria,
Villefort's mistress,

747
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,458
she had become Mrs. Danglars.

748
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,667
...

749
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,500
She is a baroness today

750
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:30,042
Morrel, on the other hand, died in poverty.

751
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:36,458
-And you, in all this, Mr. Caderousse?

752
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,292
You?

753
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:41,250
-What could I do

754
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,875
against a captain,
a count, and a prosecutor?

755
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:51,583
If I had been braver,
I would surely have ended up like her.

756
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:53,542
-Her?

757
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:55,292
-Angèle.

758
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,292
...

759
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:02,208
She had gone to see her brother
to save Dantès.

760
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,625
-I got rid of Dantès for you.

761
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:05,875
Now it's your turn
to get rid of her.

762
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,167
-You see? I have friends too.

763
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:12,417
...

764
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,500
-What happened?

765
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:18,708
Did she get killed?

766
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,583
-She would have suffered less.

767
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,625
Danglars had other plans for her.

768
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:28,792
He sold her to the Maillard brothers,
the masters of a brothel in Toulon.

769
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,833
The girl was pretty,

770
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,750
he got a good price for her.

771
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,792
-You knew everything and did nothing.

772
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,083
-I am ashamed, Father.

773
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:44,167
-One day, I will return.

774
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,917
And I will offer you the chance
to redeem yourself.

775
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,792
...

776
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,042
I no longer come to plead
or seek you out,

777
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,667
but only to warn you:

778
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,708
I am going to do
what you could not do.

779
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:17,542
From now on,
I am the one who rewards and punishes.

780
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,125
...

781
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,333
...

782
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,458
-Do you want something?

783
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:08,458
...

784
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:23,958
...

785
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,417
-Who are you?

786
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,583
-Years ago,

787
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,250
you told me:

788
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:51,875
"I will not forget your courage,
but forget my name."

789
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,125
...

790
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:58,000
Well, I have forgotten neither your name
nor your courage.

791
01:06:58,167 --> 01:06:59,292
...

792
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,125
-Dantès.

793
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:12,125
-I came to find you, Angèle.

794
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,208
-For me, it's too late.

795
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,167
But you can save the child.

796
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,292
-The child?

797
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,417
...

798
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,917
-When I arrived here,

799
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:42,500
I had only one idea in mind:

800
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,125
to take revenge on my brother.

801
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,708
For weeks,
I looked for a way to escape.

802
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:57,542
One day, the opportunity presented itself.
I fled.

803
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,000
With a client.

804
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,667
A draper from Paris.

805
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,500
I knew Gérard
had been appointed there.

806
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:11,292
...

807
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,750
I tracked down Victoria,

808
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,250
his mistress.

809
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,667
I wanted to pick up the story
where it had left off.

810
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,042
It was freezing cold.

811
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:32,792
That night...

812
01:08:32,957 --> 01:08:34,417
Gérard had to die.

813
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,042
Nothing could stop me.

814
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:42,832
I can still feel the metal of the knife
in my hand.

815
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:47,000
But nothing went as planned.

816
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,250
...

817
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,292
I heard a scream.

818
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,292
The scream of Victoria.

819
01:08:58,957 --> 01:09:03,167
When Gérard came out into the garden,
he was carrying a chest.

820
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,167
I followed him.

821
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:07,500
...

822
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:18,707
I got closer when...

823
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,832
I heard the muffled cries of a child.

824
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,375
I couldn’t leave him.

825
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:37,457
He still had his mother’s blood
on his body.

826
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,792
Between vengeance and life...

827
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,542
I chose life.

828
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,042
I fled with him.

829
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,167
I didn’t know anyone in Paris.

830
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,792
So I returned
to my draper.

831
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:11,833
But the Maillard brothers
had found him.

832
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,625
And they were waiting for me.

833
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,042
...

834
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:23,917
-Angèle...

835
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:28,917
What happened to the child?

836
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,875
...

837
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,083
Hello, André.

838
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:05,833
Angèle sent me to fetch you.

839
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:07,417
-Why?

840
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,125
-She is going to die.

841
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,292
I will take you to her
so you can say goodbye.

842
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:18,833
After, we will leave.

843
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,625
...

844
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:21,833
We will take...

845
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,792
all the time we need
to be ready.

846
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,208
-Ready for what?

847
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,833
-To take revenge, André.

848
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:35,917
To take revenge on the three men
who stole her life,

849
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,208
yours

850
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:38,792
and mine.

851
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,667
-I want to kill them.
-That would be too easy.

852
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,333
Too sweet.

853
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:48,417
No.

854
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,208
We must rip out their hearts.

855
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,958
-Who are you?

856
01:11:57,792 --> 01:12:00,167
-I am the Count of Monte Cristo.

857
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,917
-General de Morcerf
has decided today to leave the army

858
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,250
to dedicate his life to politics,
to the House of Lords.

859
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:17,917
The French army loses a great soldier,

860
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,958
but France gains a great man.

861
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,208
Fernand de Morcerf

862
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,750
fought at Moskova, at Leipzig,

863
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:26,917
in Turkey...

864
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,292
Everywhere, at the risk of his life,
he defended

865
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,792
a certain idea of the kingdom of France.

866
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:38,125
Fernand paid in flesh
the price of his commitment and the respect

867
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,625
of the word given.

868
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:43,125
Ten years ago,
when France's ally

869
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:46,917
Ali Pasha of Janina
was besieged by Turkish troops,

870
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:50,625
Colonel de Morcerf
went all in.

871
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,083
At the head of a squadron
of valiant soldiers,

872
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,125
he broke through the back line of the Ottomans

873
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,708
And come to his ally's aid.

874
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,125
This act of insane courage

875
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:07,208
unfortunately wasn't enough,
but all the French know:

876
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,000
"You do not fight
in hopes of success!

877
01:13:10,167 --> 01:13:14,125
"No! No, it is even more beautiful
when it is useless."

878
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,125
...

879
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,375
...

880
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,542
...

881
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,792
...

882
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:02,042
-Is it better?

883
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,792
-You haven't been very attentive
with Eugénie Danglars.

884
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,500
-Father.
-She will have 2 million as a dowry,

885
01:14:12,667 --> 01:14:14,167
the day of her wedding.

886
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,375
-Fernand!

887
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:17,625
-So I must pay attention
to her fortune.

888
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:18,708
...

889
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:21,708
-Better to have one less medal
and one more zero.

890
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,500
...

891
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:28,792
-Our son is a man of his time.
He is a romantic who believes in...

892
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:31,333
...

893
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,458
...

894
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,500
-Give the medal back!

895
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:17,583
...

896
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,000
...

897
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:23,292
...

898
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,250
...

899
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:32,083
...

900
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,125
...

901
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:41,917
...

902
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,542
...

903
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
-There!

904
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
...

905
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:00,125
...

906
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,083
...

907
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,083
...

908
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:15,167
...

909
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,250
That's enough.

910
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,042
...

911
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,958
...

912
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:45,583
If I had known the honor of your visit,
I would have prepared for it.

913
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:51,750
If I had known the honor of your visit,
I would have prepared for it.

914
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,167
...

915
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:04,958
...

916
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:18,750
Get out!

917
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:19,917
...

918
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:25,000
Gentlemen...
If I had known the honor of your visit,

919
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:26,083
I would have prepared for it.

920
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:30,292
I apologize for welcoming you
into an improvised home.

921
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,458
I have only been in France for a short time.

922
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,167
-Count,
I am sorry to intrude,

923
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,875
but we can never thank you enough.

924
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:42,500
-I am certain
he would have done the same for me.

925
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,958
-Count, I owe you my life.

926
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:49,500
-I am glad
to see you on your two feet.

927
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,500
-I had it repaired,
the stock was cracked.

928
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,208
-It is yours now.

929
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:02,292
-I thank you immensely,
but I cannot accept.

930
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,750
I already have a debt to you
that I do not know how to repay.

931
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:12,125
...

932
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:13,667
-Do you like weapons?

933
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,333
Please.

934
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,667
This is one of my finest pieces.

935
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:37,917
Ottoman-style pistol.

936
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:42,083
-Yes, but the iron guard
with engraved foliage

937
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,083
indicates that this barrel
is rather European-made.

938
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,792
-From Venice, indeed.

939
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,833
You are a connoisseur.

940
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,833
-My father fought
against Sultan Khursit

941
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,125
alongside Ali Pasha.

942
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,708
-Morcerf.

943
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,625
You are the famous
General de Morcerf?

944
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:01,125
I am very impressed.

945
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,458
Would you try it?

946
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,667
-Unfortunately,
I am expected at the Chamber.

947
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,292
Another time.
-It won't take a moment.

948
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,500
...

949
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:37,750
...

950
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,583
You deserve your reputation,

951
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:40,750
General.

952
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,708
Let's change the target for you, Albert.

953
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,625
-Remind me to never

954
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:57,417
challenge you to a duel.

955
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,958
-Thank you for letting me have your son
for a few hours.

956
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:05,042
I look forward to learning more about the one
that providence has placed in my path.

957
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:07,667
-I am participating in the hunt
of Baron Danglars on Sunday.

958
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:09,208
Join us.

959
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,708
-I can't, I have to welcome
the son of Prince Cavalcanti.

960
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:17,292
-Come both of you then.
There will be enough deer.

961
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:19,625
-See you soon.

962
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,875
-On Sunday, I hope.

963
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,500
...

964
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:25,875
-Is everything alright?

965
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:28,292
...

966
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:33,125
-I kept a little metal memento
from my Ottoman stay.

967
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:47,708
...

968
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:40,000
-Do you prefer singing
to the music of weapons?

969
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:45,625
Follow me.

970
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,917
-I beg your pardon.

971
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:57,292
I did not mean to disrespect
your... your wife.

972
01:24:58,292 --> 01:25:01,417
-Haydée is not my wife.
She is my goddaughter.

973
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,417
After you.

974
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:05,208
-Haydée.

975
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,083
What a wonderful name.

976
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:11,000
-It is quite a common name
in Greece.

977
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:15,792
It could be translated
as... modesty or... innocence.

978
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,250
...

979
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,208
-May I ask you
to introduce me to Haydée?

980
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:30,750
-You seem to be
a trustworthy young man.

981
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:34,750
So, I will introduce you to Haydée,
but you must make me a promise.

982
01:25:34,917 --> 01:25:36,292
-I promise you in advance.

983
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:38,792
-I am not joking.

984
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:43,417
Never seek to seduce her.

985
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:47,042
-So you think me dangerous?

986
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,292
-No.

987
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:50,542
But she is.

988
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:55,958
If you do not keep your promise,
she will break your heart

989
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,750
and her own.

990
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,458
-But...
-She is not yet ready to love.

991
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:05,042
The secret of her voice
lies in her past.

992
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:09,750
After her father's assassination,
she was sold to a Wallachian tribe.

993
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:13,042
That is where I met her
and took her in.

994
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:16,208
You know,
there are sorrows and wounds

995
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:18,417
that take years to heal.

996
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,875
They leave a veil
over the souls.

997
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,875
Never try
to lift that veil, Albert.

998
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,542
-I promise you.

999
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,125
-Good.

1000
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:38,000
You will walk softly,
without a glance at us.

1001
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:40,333
You will only turn around
when I call you.

1002
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,083
Haydée.

1003
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,917
Albert de Morcerf,
I present to you Haydée.

1004
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,125
-Delighted.

1005
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,125
Delighted.

1006
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,250
-Delighted, miss.

1007
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:01,417
-And what if he doesn’t
try to meet me?

1008
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:02,958
-He will.

1009
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,125
Stand tall!

1010
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:08,542
Standing straight is surviving.

1011
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:11,583
Hiding that you grew up in poverty,
is surviving.

1012
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,792
Do you understand? Why, André?

1013
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:17,792
-Because I am Prince
Andrea Cavalcanti.

1014
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:21,375
-Cavalcanti, doesn't that mean goat?
-What?

1015
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:24,458
-Don't look surprised.
Do you hear me say "what"?

1016
01:27:24,625 --> 01:27:25,625
Start again.

1017
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,625
-I am Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

1018
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:33,208
-You don't have an accent, prince.
How come?

1019
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,208
-A very strict teacher
made me lose it with a stick.

1020
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,708
-Impertinence. Your elbows.

1021
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,000
-Dear count,

1022
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:48,417
I am pleased to meet you.
-Allow me a confession.

1023
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:52,417
French life is still unknown to me,
I beg your pardon

1024
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:55,875
if my manners seem
too Slavic, Neapolitan, or Arab.

1025
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,208
Barking

1026
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:35,250
-Here is Count of Monte-Cristo
and Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

1027
01:28:35,417 --> 01:28:36,667
...

1028
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:39,000
-Gentlemen.
-Count.

1029
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:41,125
Prince.

1030
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:45,083
-The meeting with your father,
as overwhelming as it is,

1031
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:48,917
must not divert you from your target:
Baron Danglars.

1032
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:52,542
Thanks to stolen boats,
he made a fortune in slavery.

1033
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:56,000
-Your reputation precedes you.
-Don't trust his smile.

1034
01:28:56,167 --> 01:28:59,500
He is brutal. Not only is he aware of it,
he's proud of it.

1035
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,292
May I confess something to you?

1036
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:06,333
French life is still unknown to me,
I would ask you to excuse me

1037
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,333
if my manners seem
too Slavic, Neapolitan, or Arab.

1038
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,625
-When one is rich,
one is never too anything.

1039
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,042
-His daughter is his weak point.

1040
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,167
-Prince.

1041
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:18,750
-Baron.

1042
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:20,458
-Eugénie.
-Is the ground good?

1043
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:23,042
-It’s perfect.
-Then let’s go.

1044
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:24,792
On horseback, gentlemen.

1045
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,083
...

1046
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,458
...

1047
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,625
...

1048
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:20,833
...

1049
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:44,542
...

1050
01:30:48,917 --> 01:30:50,792
...

1051
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:00,792
Your honor, Count.

1052
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,542
-Thank you,

1053
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,708
but I swore long ago

1054
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,542
to only kill in self-defense.

1055
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,708
-Then let me take your defense.

1056
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,792
...

1057
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:13,958
-Perfect.

1058
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:16,083
Prince.

1059
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,542
Please.

1060
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,708
...

1061
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:03,792
Let’s go have lunch.

1062
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,750
...

1063
01:32:18,917 --> 01:32:19,917
-Eugénie?

1064
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:27,000
-Thank you. Suzanne, I present to you
Prince Andrea Cavalcanti,

1065
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:29,292
Monte-Cristo's Italian protégé.

1066
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,792
-He looks after me.

1067
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,917
My father fears that the beauties of Paris
will lead me to make foolish decisions.

1068
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:35,750
-You speak perfect French.

1069
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:40,500
-A very strict teacher made me
lose my accent with a stick.

1070
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:43,833
-But that’s awful.
-That’s false, mostly.

1071
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,292
My mother is French.
-What an idiot.

1072
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:50,000
-I’m glad
you could join us.

1073
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:52,792
-Your protégé's hand
didn't tremble.

1074
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,500
The animal didn't even suffer.

1075
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:57,625
-And it’s a specialist in executions
who speaks to you.

1076
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,417
-Do you often chop off heads?

1077
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:03,250
-Much less than before.
The trend is towards leniency.

1078
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:08,167
-Excuse me for stealing the Count away,
but I want to introduce him to someone.

1079
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,458
-Count.
-Gentlemen.

1080
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:13,167
...

1081
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:30,500
Muffled conversation

1082
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:34,417
-Dear.

1083
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,917
I finally introduce you
to Count of Monte-Cristo.

1084
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:44,250
-Madame de Morcerf. My respects.

1085
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:49,792
-Is everything all right?

1086
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,583
-Yes, it’s...

1087
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:54,542
...

1088
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:59,000
It's the emotion of meeting the man
without whom I would be in tears.

1089
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:03,375
Sir,
I owe you my son's life,

1090
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,417
and for this kindness, I bless you.

1091
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:08,083
...

1092
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:11,667
-You reward me too generously
for a simple act.

1093
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:15,333
But I am happy
to have spared you the sorrow.

1094
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,000
-I proposed to the Count
to be our guest,

1095
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:20,542
but he has so far refused.

1096
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,208
Perhaps you will have
better luck?

1097
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:32,083
-Will you do me the pleasure and honor
of being our guest one day?

1098
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,375
-Certainly, madam.

1099
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:39,625
-Permit me to take my leave.
I would hate to monopolize you.

1100
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,167
-But... what is happening?

1101
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:56,375
...

1102
01:34:56,542 --> 01:34:58,417
Would you like me to call someone?

1103
01:34:58,583 --> 01:34:59,667
-Albert.

1104
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,292
What do you know about this man?

1105
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
-Mother.

1106
01:35:06,042 --> 01:35:09,125
You always distrust my new acquaintances,

1107
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:11,125
but the Count saved my life.

1108
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:12,917
He is as rich as a king.

1109
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,500
What should I fear from him?

1110
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:19,875
-You are right.

1111
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,083
My fears are foolish.

1112
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:54,958
...

1113
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:04,583
...

1114
01:36:17,208 --> 01:36:18,833
...

1115
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,375
...

1116
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:36,125
-Mr. Attorney General,

1117
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:39,750
it is on my honor, as a lieutenant of the royal armies,

1118
01:36:39,917 --> 01:36:42,625
that I attest here
that the named Edmond Dantès

1119
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:45,625
has shown in my presence
and on numerous occasions

1120
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:47,625
sympathy for the usurper

1121
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:51,583
and his desire to take up arms
to overthrow the monarchy.

1122
01:36:52,125 --> 01:36:54,792
These words weigh heavily on me
because Edmond Dantès was my friend,

1123
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,750
but I cannot let this crime go unpunished.

1124
01:36:57,917 --> 01:37:01,250
I have seen too many men die
because of traitors to the homeland.

1125
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:04,250
-That is not how you will find sleep.

1126
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:06,250
-I wasn’t looking for it.

1127
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:10,042
-Do you fear your nightmares?

1128
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,167
-I fear not having them anymore.

1129
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:19,583
They help me keep
my wounds open.

1130
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:25,625
-Have you seen her again?

1131
01:37:27,125 --> 01:37:28,125
-Yes.

1132
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:34,000
-Was she as beautiful
as in your memories?

1133
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:40,375
-I thought that grief
would have changed her.

1134
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,542
It must have been short-lived.

1135
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:50,458
Her eyes were not those
of a woman who has cried too much.

1136
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:55,292
...

1137
01:37:57,792 --> 01:38:01,375
-She will find the taste for tears
when they take her husband away.

1138
01:38:12,292 --> 01:38:14,167
...

1139
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,750
-I’m passing.

1140
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:32,792
-200...

1141
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:34,750
plus 500.

1142
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,208
-I fold.

1143
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:40,375
-I wouldn’t invite you to my table
if you knew how to play.

1144
01:38:40,542 --> 01:38:41,250
...

1145
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,792
There you go.

1146
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:45,583
There are only three of us left.

1147
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:49,083
-I’ll leave you two alone.

1148
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:55,000
-Two pairs.

1149
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,500
-Well done.

1150
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:00,750
Color.

1151
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,458
-You have far too many hearts.

1152
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:06,542
I’m fleeing before I ruin my father.

1153
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:09,458
Come on, let’s go, Albert.
-Yes, that’s right,

1154
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:13,208
go see those ladies.
-Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.

1155
01:39:13,375 --> 01:39:14,375
...

1156
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:18,708
-I like your prince very much.

1157
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:19,625
He is charming.

1158
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:24,375
-I barely know him, to be honest.
His father is a business associate.

1159
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:28,000
-A good family, without a doubt.

1160
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:32,792
-If by "good," you mean "rich,"
then yes, it’s the second fortune of Italy.

1161
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:34,042
-Hm...

1162
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,958
The second?

1163
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:38,542
So you know the first?

1164
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:40,667
-Don’t make me immodest.

1165
01:39:40,833 --> 01:39:41,500
...

1166
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:43,792
-Finally, people richer than me.

1167
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:49,042
-His family dreams of seeing him marry
a girl in Paris, but...

1168
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:52,333
if the son is as fickle as the father,
beware.

1169
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,208
-Rest assured,

1170
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:57,083
I distrust everyone in general.

1171
01:39:57,833 --> 01:40:00,250
And foreigners, in particular.

1172
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:03,167
-I am a foreigner myself.

1173
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,417
-You, Count, that doesn’t count.
You are a count.

1174
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,833
And besides, it rhymes, you see?

1175
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,917
-You are a poet.

1176
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,125
-By the way, speaking of foreigners,

1177
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:14,458
L'Impartial was bought
by an Englishman.

1178
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:15,792
-Absolutely,

1179
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:18,875
a certain Halifax.
A Lord, it seems.

1180
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:23,792
-He buys newspapers
to spread false news

1181
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:25,250
and speculate on the stock market.

1182
01:40:25,417 --> 01:40:27,375
He is a rogue of the worst kind.

1183
01:40:28,792 --> 01:40:31,542
-You don’t seem to like
this Lord very much.

1184
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:34,167
-Let's just say I like many people,

1185
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:37,000
but I only truly hate
certain individuals.

1186
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:40,542
-Hating an Englishman is not a sin.
It’s common sense.

1187
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:41,917
...

1188
01:40:44,792 --> 01:40:46,125
-Are you leaving already?

1189
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:49,875
-It’s almost midnight.
Our carriage will turn into a pumpkin.

1190
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:52,875
...

1191
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:56,417
Albert.

1192
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,833
-Miss.

1193
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,792
You were about to forget your fan.

1194
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:07,083
-Thank you, sir.

1195
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:14,583
-Can I count on you?
-For what?

1196
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:16,917
-To join me for dinner

1197
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:20,375
that I am organizing soon in Paris.
I found a place to stay.

1198
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:23,708
-Well... Of course.

1199
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:25,542
-Good.

1200
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:27,917
-See you soon.

1201
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:36,708
-Count.

1202
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,875
-Madame de Morcerf.

1203
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:42,708
-You’re leaving just as I arrive.

1204
01:41:43,292 --> 01:41:44,625
-Don’t see any connection.

1205
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:47,875
-I wanted to apologize to you.

1206
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:51,500
-Apologize to me?

1207
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,333
-For my dizziness the other day.

1208
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:59,042
You reminded me of someone
I once knew well who disappeared

1209
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:00,917
under tragic circumstances.

1210
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:03,833
...

1211
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,792
For a moment, I...

1212
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:16,542
It’s happening again,
I can’t find my words.

1213
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:18,667
...

1214
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:22,708
-I’m sorry to have reminded you
of that painful memory.

1215
01:42:25,667 --> 01:42:27,667
-Rest assured, it has dissipated.

1216
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:32,333
-Good.

1217
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:36,792
I wish you a good evening.

1218
01:42:38,042 --> 01:42:39,208
-Count.

1219
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:46,083
...

1220
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:48,958
...

1221
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,083
-Albert.

1222
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:07,625
-"Haydée.

1223
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:11,458
"I'm not supposed to write to you.
So I won't write to you.

1224
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:12,792
...

1225
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:14,708
"I must not meet you..."

1226
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:18,208
-So I won't suggest
that we meet at the Jardin des Plantes,

1227
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:20,042
tomorrow at 5 o'clock.

1228
01:43:20,417 --> 01:43:22,750
This place, where I won't be tomorrow,

1229
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:25,500
holds the most mysterious flowers
of Paris.

1230
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:30,375
You come from a country nicknamed
the land of clouds and jasmine.

1231
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,667
We can count on the Parisian sky
for the clouds,

1232
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:35,708
I'll have jasmine in my buttonhole.

1233
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:38,208
So I won't say see you tomorrow.

1234
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,833
And I won't tell you
that since I saw you,

1235
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,125
your voice and your face
have not left my mind.

1236
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:45,750
Albert.

1237
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:47,500
...

1238
01:43:51,167 --> 01:43:52,875
Is he going to report us?

1239
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:54,792
-He is very loyal to the Count,

1240
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:57,208
but he has a weakness for me.

1241
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:02,042
It's a strelitzia.

1242
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:06,583
Where I come from, there were some
on a path leading to the sea.

1243
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:09,917
It's also called the bird of paradise,

1244
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,583
pasărea paradisului.

1245
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,708
-Pasărea paradisului?

1246
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:16,375
-Exactly.

1247
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:25,500
How is it that you don't have a fiancée?

1248
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:27,708
But maybe you do?

1249
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,458
-My father wants me to marry the daughter of a baron.

1250
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:33,417
But I...

1251
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:36,458
I'm looking for something
that this young lady will never have.

1252
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:42,875
That... indefinable charm that is to a woman
what fragrance is to a flower.

1253
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:46,458
Or what flavor is to fruit.

1254
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:50,167
-I don't know if Parisian women
like to be picked or tasted,

1255
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:51,333
but not me.

1256
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,292
-That's not what I meant.
-I was teasing you.

1257
01:44:56,125 --> 01:44:58,542
Will you be at the Count's dinner on Saturday?

1258
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,458
-No. I will serve as an alibi for my mother

1259
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:03,958
who avoids social events like the plague.

1260
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:05,333
And you?

1261
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:08,292
-I don't know your mother,

1262
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,792
I don't know her tastes,

1263
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,750
but I share her dislikes.

1264
01:45:13,208 --> 01:45:13,958
...

1265
01:45:17,667 --> 01:45:20,083
Neither he nor his mother will come to the dinner.

1266
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:23,333
But Fernand de Morcerf
will certainly be present.

1267
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:31,917
What's the matter?

1268
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:35,875
-Are you not going to tell me about Albert?

1269
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,333
-There’s nothing to say.

1270
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:54,250
-It’s normal to doubt.

1271
01:45:56,208 --> 01:45:58,875
To be afraid. I understand that.

1272
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,208
But when the time comes,
you must remember...

1273
01:46:03,583 --> 01:46:04,875
-I don’t need you

1274
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:07,708
to remind me of what his father did to mine.

1275
01:46:15,167 --> 01:46:17,167
He placed his lips there.

1276
01:46:24,167 --> 01:46:25,917
...

1277
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,333
-Thank you,

1278
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,833
my dear.
-Of course.

1279
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,958
Dear friends.

1280
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:55,750
-Good evening, Victoria.

1281
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:02,125
-I expected something more spectacular,

1282
01:47:02,292 --> 01:47:04,000
there's no need to make that face.

1283
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:06,667
-There must be surprises inside.

1284
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,667
...

1285
01:47:24,292 --> 01:47:25,625
-Hm...

1286
01:47:25,792 --> 01:47:27,000
...

1287
01:47:27,917 --> 01:47:30,542
...

1288
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:33,250
-You seem
to have little appetite.

1289
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:35,750
-I had an appetite before the pig
and the poultry.

1290
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:37,125
...

1291
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:40,375
-This house is... magnificent.

1292
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:43,042
-I sense you are still surprised.

1293
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:45,042
-Nothing escapes you.

1294
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:46,542
...

1295
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:51,042
I thought a man like you
would choose a more central neighborhood,

1296
01:47:51,208 --> 01:47:54,667
like... the Champs-Élysées
or Saint-Germain.

1297
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:58,000
-I bought this house precisely because it was advised against.

1298
01:47:58,792 --> 01:47:59,625
-Why?

1299
01:48:00,667 --> 01:48:03,667
-Well, they say it's haunted.
Gasps from the guests

1300
01:48:03,833 --> 01:48:08,000
-They say a crime occurred here...
an abominable one, years ago.

1301
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:10,792
-Be careful,
we have the King's prosecutor here.

1302
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:11,792
-It's true.

1303
01:48:11,958 --> 01:48:13,333
...

1304
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,083
-A child was said to have been sacrificed.

1305
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:16,792
...

1306
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:18,083
-That's dreadful.

1307
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:21,417
-You bought this house despite everything?

1308
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:22,917
-You did well.

1309
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:25,917
These ghost stories
are nonsense

1310
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,292
invented
by malicious servants.

1311
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:29,792
Or jealous neighbors.

1312
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:32,375
-Don't be mistaken, prosecutor.

1313
01:48:32,542 --> 01:48:35,000
I lived in Asia and the Indies,

1314
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,542
and it's hard to return
without knowing that there indeed exists

1315
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:40,917
a world...

1316
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,458
invisible, populated by spirits.

1317
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:47,417
When I visited this house, I...

1318
01:48:48,042 --> 01:48:49,542
I immediately knew...

1319
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:55,208
I had the strange conviction
that a crime had been committed here.

1320
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:57,875
So I asked

1321
01:48:58,042 --> 01:49:00,292
to be left alone.
-But...

1322
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:01,667
were you not afraid?

1323
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,875
-If your conscience is pure,
ghosts do not haunt you.

1324
01:49:06,042 --> 01:49:07,000
They speak to you.

1325
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:12,125
-And what did they tell you?
-But yes, what did they tell you?

1326
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:19,542
-That night,
I settled here.

1327
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:21,875
Right in front of this fireplace.

1328
01:49:23,542 --> 01:49:26,917
I smoked a bit of opium
to be more receptive.

1329
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:31,125
There's nothing like it to expand
the spectrum of your consciousness.

1330
01:49:34,042 --> 01:49:36,167
And in the sweetness of the smoke...

1331
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:38,125
...

1332
01:49:38,292 --> 01:49:41,542
I felt as if... suspended.

1333
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:46,042
I hear a knock in the walls.

1334
01:49:47,542 --> 01:49:48,708
Then a second.

1335
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:51,167
...

1336
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:53,792
I place my hand.

1337
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:58,625
And I hear screams coming from upstairs.
I go up the stairs.

1338
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:03,250
The screams turn into... moans.

1339
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,750
It comes from a room

1340
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:08,083
at the end of the hallway.

1341
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:10,167
...

1342
01:50:10,333 --> 01:50:13,083
I push the door
and find myself in a bedroom.

1343
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,750
In the middle, there's a bed.

1344
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:16,375
I place my hand on it.

1345
01:50:19,833 --> 01:50:21,958
And I see a woman
writhing in pain.

1346
01:50:22,542 --> 01:50:27,667
She is giving birth to a child.
She is alone, abandoned.

1347
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:28,875
She screams.

1348
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:34,458
And then I feel a presence
behind me.

1349
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:36,208
All of a sudden.

1350
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:39,333
It knocks on the table.
Victoria screams.

1351
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,042
-You frighten these ladies.

1352
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:42,750
-And you entertain us.

1353
01:50:43,042 --> 01:50:44,958
Continue, I beg you.

1354
01:50:45,125 --> 01:50:47,333
Get a hold of yourself, you're ruining the party.

1355
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:50,667
-I turn around, trembling.

1356
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:53,583
And at that moment,

1357
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:56,792
I hear a whisper
in my ear.

1358
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,083
It's the voice of a child.

1359
01:51:01,708 --> 01:51:03,375
The voice of a child begging me

1360
01:51:03,542 --> 01:51:04,667
to set him free.

1361
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,583
I finally find a door,

1362
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:11,583
a hidden door
that I hadn't seen.

1363
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:13,667
I push it open.

1364
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,167
Stairs... They lead to the garden.

1365
01:51:18,333 --> 01:51:20,750
And the child's voice returned.

1366
01:51:20,917 --> 01:51:25,042
He told me he had been alone
for so long. He was crying.

1367
01:51:25,542 --> 01:51:26,917
He calls for his mother.

1368
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:28,750
...

1369
01:51:32,083 --> 01:51:33,500
That night, I...

1370
01:51:34,417 --> 01:51:35,958
I searched, but...

1371
01:51:37,417 --> 01:51:39,208
the garden was too big.

1372
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,792
-What... What did you do?

1373
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:53,208
-Pardon?

1374
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,000
-The garden was too big...

1375
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:58,333
What did you do?

1376
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:01,458
-Yes.

1377
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,167
...

1378
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:14,333
The next morning,
we dug.

1379
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:16,042
Everywhere.

1380
01:52:16,792 --> 01:52:20,042
We uprooted the apple trees,
turned over the path...

1381
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:21,875
And nothing.

1382
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:24,250
...

1383
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:27,458
So I had a truffle pig brought in from Périgord.

1384
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:30,125
-And then?

1385
01:52:31,917 --> 01:52:32,917
...

1386
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:35,125
-Since it didn't find anything either,

1387
01:52:36,042 --> 01:52:37,667
we ate it that evening.

1388
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,750
-Wonderful!

1389
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:44,375
-I did say
it was just a fable.

1390
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:47,167
-A fable, exactly.

1391
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:51,000
At least, that's what I believed.
Until yesterday.

1392
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:54,167
While we were planting

1393
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:56,417
the torches for the reception,

1394
01:52:57,083 --> 01:52:59,167
one of them broke clean.

1395
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:03,000
We dug at that spot and...

1396
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:05,750
we discovered a chest.

1397
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:07,375
-And then?

1398
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:10,833
What was inside?

1399
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:13,750
-I don't know.

1400
01:53:13,917 --> 01:53:14,792
-What do you mean?

1401
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:15,958
...

1402
01:53:17,042 --> 01:53:19,542
-I waited for you... to open it.

1403
01:53:19,708 --> 01:53:22,667
...

1404
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,750
-And what if there's a body?

1405
01:53:40,167 --> 01:53:41,750
-We will give it a burial.

1406
01:53:47,292 --> 01:53:49,167
Prosecutor, perhaps you'd like

1407
01:53:49,333 --> 01:53:50,333
to open it?

1408
01:53:54,042 --> 01:53:56,417
-I beg you, don't open it.
-Enough.

1409
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:20,958
-Abracadabra!

1410
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:22,750
...

1411
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,167
-Oh, I don't know

1412
01:54:26,333 --> 01:54:29,292
what's true in this story,
but you are a magician,

1413
01:54:29,458 --> 01:54:30,708
count.

1414
01:54:30,875 --> 01:54:34,250
...

1415
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:39,792
-How is it possible?
He spoke as if he had been present.

1416
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:43,292
All those details, it was...
I thought I was going crazy.

1417
01:54:43,458 --> 01:54:45,208
-Calm down, please.

1418
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:47,750
-Where is our child's body?
-I don't know.

1419
01:54:47,917 --> 01:54:49,667
-You had placed it there, right?
-Yes.

1420
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:52,708
-You told me he was dead!
You told me!

1421
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,500
-Of course, he was dead.

1422
01:54:54,667 --> 01:54:57,000
-Then where is he?
-I don't know.

1423
01:54:57,167 --> 01:54:59,208
-Where is our child?
-I don't know!

1424
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:02,792
Be quiet, you are hysterical!
I don't know.

1425
01:55:02,958 --> 01:55:05,083
Calm down.

1426
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:06,750
...

1427
01:55:06,917 --> 01:55:08,292
I know one thing.

1428
01:55:08,917 --> 01:55:10,500
It's that within eight days,

1429
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:13,042
I will know who this Mr. Monte-Cristo is,

1430
01:55:13,542 --> 01:55:16,417
where he comes from, where he's going,

1431
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:20,292
and why he speaks before us
of buried children.

1432
01:55:20,458 --> 01:55:21,458
...

1433
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:26,333
-Danglars is obsessed with money.

1434
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,958
He won't be wary of someone

1435
01:55:28,125 --> 01:55:30,042
who asks for none.
Morcerf trusts me

1436
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:32,208
since I saved his son.

1437
01:55:32,375 --> 01:55:33,500
Then there's Villefort.

1438
01:55:33,917 --> 01:55:35,375
Villefort is the prosecutor.

1439
01:55:35,542 --> 01:55:36,583
He is suspicious.

1440
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:41,583
And thanks to this dinner,
Victoria will demand explanations.

1441
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,125
So to reassure her
and reassure himself,

1442
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:45,833
he will conduct an investigation.

1443
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:50,250
And since we always learn more
from malicious tongues,

1444
01:55:50,417 --> 01:55:52,708
it's the count's enemy he will visit.

1445
01:55:53,333 --> 01:55:54,708
Lord Halifax.

1446
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,250
(English accent)
-What do you want to know?

1447
01:55:57,625 --> 01:56:01,875
If I can harm him,
it will be my pleasure.

1448
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,458
-Has the count ever been to Paris?
He claims he hasn't.

1449
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:09,625
-If he had already come, I would know.

1450
01:56:10,042 --> 01:56:13,917
-But then, do you know
where he was 15 years ago?

1451
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:16,458
...

1452
01:56:17,917 --> 01:56:18,750
But...

1453
01:56:18,917 --> 01:56:20,208
I must say,

1454
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,417
at that time, he still amused me.

1455
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,667
But after...

1456
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:29,958
-After what?

1457
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:35,125
-Well, one evening I was correcting a servant

1458
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:37,125
who had it coming.

1459
01:56:38,042 --> 01:56:39,125
But...

1460
01:56:39,667 --> 01:56:43,458
Monte-Cristo had taken a passion
for those savages,

1461
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:48,500
with their pagan gods,
their absurd magic.

1462
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:50,167
Ridiculous beliefs.

1463
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:54,542
So he challenged me to a duel.

1464
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:56,667
-For a native?

1465
01:56:56,833 --> 01:56:59,917
-Yes! A native!

1466
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:01,708
Can you believe it?

1467
01:57:01,875 --> 01:57:03,958
Ah.

1468
01:57:04,583 --> 01:57:07,083
It's hot, don't you think?
What heat!

1469
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:10,125
Someone bring me my fan,
for heaven's sake!

1470
01:57:11,042 --> 01:57:12,708
We're suffocating in here!

1471
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:16,375
Not that one.

1472
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:18,083
Thank you.

1473
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:20,500
...

1474
01:57:21,042 --> 01:57:22,042
...

1475
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:23,708
Hm. And you,

1476
01:57:24,833 --> 01:57:26,250
Mr. Villefort?

1477
01:57:27,292 --> 01:57:28,417
What has he done to you?

1478
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
-Nothing.

1479
01:57:31,375 --> 01:57:34,708
I don't know if I should count him
among my friends or enemies.

1480
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:39,542
-If he were your enemy,
you would know already.

1481
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:43,750
He has flaws, but he’s not
the type to hide his intentions.

1482
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:44,917
Hm.

1483
01:57:45,583 --> 01:57:46,583
But...

1484
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:48,583
be careful.

1485
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,000
Mr. Prosecutor.

1486
01:57:50,167 --> 01:57:51,875
...

1487
01:57:52,042 --> 01:57:54,208
If he becomes your friend,

1488
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:57,875
that will make you my enemy.

1489
01:57:59,708 --> 01:58:00,917
-Of course.

1490
01:58:03,625 --> 01:58:04,375
...

1491
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:10,375
-Yes.

1492
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:13,500
Thank you, Mr. Villefort,
it was very pleasant

1493
01:58:13,667 --> 01:58:16,583
to talk with you,
but I have much to do.

1494
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,917
-I thank you.

1495
01:58:19,292 --> 01:58:20,917
-Mr. Prosecutor.

1496
01:58:30,208 --> 01:58:31,208
Victor.

1497
01:58:33,042 --> 01:58:34,042
-Count?

1498
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:36,292
-Prepare the horses,
we are going back.

1499
01:58:47,542 --> 01:58:49,667
Now that Villefort
has let his guard down,

1500
01:58:49,833 --> 01:58:52,167
we can prepare our attack.

1501
01:58:53,542 --> 01:58:54,917
I’m heading south.

1502
01:58:55,083 --> 01:58:58,708
I’ll return for Danglars’ party
for his daughter's 20th birthday.

1503
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,417
I’m counting on you,

1504
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:02,583
André, to get close to her.

1505
01:59:03,625 --> 01:59:06,333
And on you, Haydée,
to enchant Albert.

1506
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:09,583
...

1507
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,167
-Go ahead.

1508
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:14,000
Good.

1509
01:59:14,167 --> 01:59:18,125
-It can hold up to 600 slaves,
700 if pushed a bit, but...

1510
01:59:18,292 --> 01:59:20,083
I am a humanitarian.

1511
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,750
I named it Hercules.

1512
01:59:21,917 --> 01:59:26,458
-My mother said that's the line
of people destined for great things.

1513
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:30,583
And this is your... love line.

1514
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:33,792
And here, I read that...

1515
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,542
-I need to tell you something.

1516
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:38,000
...

1517
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,500
-Yes?

1518
01:59:47,542 --> 01:59:49,042
-I would like to love you,

1519
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:52,125
but I can’t.
-I know.

1520
01:59:55,083 --> 01:59:56,208
You won't offer me

1521
01:59:56,375 --> 01:59:58,625
the feelings
you have for Suzanne.

1522
01:59:58,792 --> 02:00:00,000
-It will be our secret.

1523
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:02,833
-It will be our secret.
It will be well kept.

1524
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,250
-I know what it’s like
to be double.

1525
02:00:06,083 --> 02:00:07,917
-I know what it’s like
to be double.

1526
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:11,000
Not being able to say who you are.

1527
02:00:13,375 --> 02:00:14,625
I will be your alibi.

1528
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:16,750
...

1529
02:00:22,917 --> 02:00:24,125
...

1530
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:51,958
...

1531
02:00:57,042 --> 02:00:59,250
-The time has come to redeem yourself.

1532
02:00:59,417 --> 02:01:02,125
...

1533
02:01:12,792 --> 02:01:15,083
...

1534
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,042
-I relive in dreams

1535
02:01:48,208 --> 02:01:50,375
every second of those moments with you.

1536
02:01:50,917 --> 02:01:53,792
I will carry into my night
the memory of your eyes,

1537
02:01:54,833 --> 02:01:56,625
and I don't want to speak to anyone

1538
02:01:56,792 --> 02:01:58,917
to not waste
the echo of your words

1539
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:00,833
that still trembles in my heart.

1540
02:02:02,208 --> 02:02:04,458
I keep your score close to me.

1541
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:08,250
I love it for the image
it gives me of you,

1542
02:02:08,417 --> 02:02:12,208
but also and above all for the memory
it will forever hold,

1543
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:15,792
that of a moment of life
that is worth a whole lifetime.

1544
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,375
...

1545
02:02:39,708 --> 02:02:41,958
...

1546
02:02:44,125 --> 02:02:46,292
...

1547
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:50,750
...

1548
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,667
-See you later.
-See you later.

1549
02:03:07,292 --> 02:03:08,292
-Prince.

1550
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,458
...

1551
02:03:12,625 --> 02:03:15,583
-Eugénie. This party is a reflection of you,
vibrant and joyful.

1552
02:03:16,167 --> 02:03:17,583
-Thank you, Andrea.

1553
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:20,833
-Will you count the Count of Monte Cristo
among your guests?

1554
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:22,583
-17.

1555
02:03:23,208 --> 02:03:23,875
-17?

1556
02:03:24,792 --> 02:03:27,125
-You are the 17th
to ask me that question.

1557
02:03:27,292 --> 02:03:29,250
-And what do you answer everyone?

1558
02:03:29,708 --> 02:03:32,708
-That there won't be an 18th. Here he is.

1559
02:03:32,875 --> 02:03:34,583
...

1560
02:03:37,292 --> 02:03:38,250
-Excuse me.

1561
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:44,917
Miss.

1562
02:03:45,417 --> 02:03:48,375
Count. Did you have a good trip?
-Wonderful.

1563
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:52,083
Thank you.
-Eugénie is eager

1564
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:53,875
to see you again, miss.

1565
02:03:54,333 --> 02:03:55,917
Count, may I?

1566
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,042
-With pleasure.

1567
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:08,958
-Does the count know
that we have met?

1568
02:04:09,417 --> 02:04:11,000
-I haven't told him anything.

1569
02:04:12,167 --> 02:04:16,000
-Can he have guessed?
-God alone knows what he is capable of.

1570
02:04:17,917 --> 02:04:19,375
-Aren't they beautiful?

1571
02:04:21,167 --> 02:04:23,292
They seem so eager to live.

1572
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,542
-One is always eager to be happy.

1573
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,500
No?

1574
02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:34,458
-Honor me with your arm.

1575
02:04:34,917 --> 02:04:36,583
I want to take a few steps.

1576
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:16,167
-Your hand trembles.

1577
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:18,625
You seem cold.

1578
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:22,667
-In my family,
we have cold hands but warm hearts.

1579
02:05:23,167 --> 02:05:25,833
Here. This will warm us.

1580
02:05:26,958 --> 02:05:28,917
Our grapes are not as good
as in Sicily

1581
02:05:29,083 --> 02:05:32,000
but you will be indulgent
with our northern sun.

1582
02:05:32,292 --> 02:05:33,583
-I regret.

1583
02:05:35,875 --> 02:05:38,042
I beg your pardon, but...

1584
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:40,250
I never drink.

1585
02:05:42,792 --> 02:05:44,667
-Will you at least eat something?

1586
02:05:47,042 --> 02:05:49,000
-I will have to decline again.

1587
02:05:50,875 --> 02:05:55,208
-Mr. Count, there is an Arab custom
that makes friends eternally

1588
02:05:55,375 --> 02:05:58,417
those who have shared bread and salt
under the same roof.

1589
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:00,833
-I know it, madam.

1590
02:06:01,667 --> 02:06:04,083
But we are in Paris
and not in Tangier.

1591
02:06:05,042 --> 02:06:09,417
Here, there is no more eternal friendship
than sharing bread and salt.

1592
02:06:31,333 --> 02:06:34,458
-But after all...
We are friends, aren't we?

1593
02:06:35,333 --> 02:06:36,583
-Of course.

1594
02:06:37,542 --> 02:06:39,250
Why wouldn't we be?

1595
02:06:43,458 --> 02:06:48,375
-So, in the absence of bread and salt,
share with me some memories.

1596
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:52,708
-What would you like to know?

1597
02:06:55,208 --> 02:06:57,417
-Is it true that you have seen so much,

1598
02:06:57,958 --> 02:06:59,375
traveled so much,

1599
02:06:59,625 --> 02:07:00,875
suffered so much?

1600
02:07:01,667 --> 02:07:03,333
-What makes you say that?

1601
02:07:05,208 --> 02:07:06,292
-Your eyes.

1602
02:07:09,125 --> 02:07:13,042
-There is in every traveler the desire
to find or to flee something.

1603
02:07:15,667 --> 02:07:17,000
-Did you find it?

1604
02:07:17,583 --> 02:07:19,333
-I haven't finished my journey.

1605
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:26,083
-Do you live alone?

1606
02:07:28,167 --> 02:07:31,292
-I have neither sister, nor son, nor father.

1607
02:07:35,375 --> 02:07:39,833
I only have Haydée
who, I am sure, will leave me soon.

1608
02:07:42,708 --> 02:07:44,833
-How can you live like this,

1609
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:46,917
with nothing
that ties you to life?

1610
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,000
-I loved a young woman.

1611
02:07:55,958 --> 02:07:57,375
That I was going to marry.

1612
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:01,625
Years ago.

1613
02:08:02,125 --> 02:08:05,833
But when the war came
and took me far from her...

1614
02:08:06,208 --> 02:08:07,417
...

1615
02:08:07,583 --> 02:08:09,875
...

1616
02:08:10,042 --> 02:08:12,625
I thought she would love me enough
to wait for me.

1617
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:19,708
To remain faithful to me
until the grave.

1618
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:25,042
But when I returned,

1619
02:08:26,083 --> 02:08:27,458
she was married.

1620
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:35,375
I may have had a heart
weaker than others.

1621
02:08:37,708 --> 02:08:40,083
I suffered
more than they would have.

1622
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,500
That's all. 
-That love has remained in your heart?

1623
02:08:47,875 --> 02:08:49,708
-We truly love only once.

1624
02:08:51,125 --> 02:08:52,000
Don't we?

1625
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:56,208
-Have you seen her again?

1626
02:09:00,708 --> 02:09:01,625
-Never.

1627
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,000
-Never?

1628
02:09:08,583 --> 02:09:09,708
-Never.

1629
02:09:10,333 --> 02:09:13,417
...

1630
02:09:13,917 --> 02:09:15,042
...

1631
02:09:16,583 --> 02:09:19,292
-Have you forgiven her
for your suffering?

1632
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:24,750
-One can only forgive
those who ask for forgiveness.

1633
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,875
-And if she asked you for forgiveness
today?

1634
02:09:37,667 --> 02:09:39,667
...

1635
02:09:41,792 --> 02:09:43,667
...

1636
02:09:43,833 --> 02:09:46,833
...

1637
02:09:49,625 --> 02:09:52,833
-Buy L'Impartial!
The Danglars fleet stolen in Marseille!

1638
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,500
L'Impartial, ladies and gentlemen!
L'Impartial!

1639
02:09:56,667 --> 02:09:57,667
Buy!

1640
02:09:57,833 --> 02:10:01,042
-How can one steal ships
in a port in broad daylight?

1641
02:10:01,458 --> 02:10:02,833
They were insured, at least?

1642
02:10:03,167 --> 02:10:04,250
-What do you think?

1643
02:10:04,625 --> 02:10:07,208
-The Danglars stock is crashing.

1644
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:10,042
But thanks to the army's telegraph,

1645
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:15,417
Danglars will quickly learn
that nothing really happened.

1646
02:10:15,583 --> 02:10:17,083
-You were supposed to steal his ships.

1647
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:19,667
-Everything comes to those who wait.

1648
02:10:19,833 --> 02:10:22,542
-You are safe. Your ships are fine.

1649
02:10:22,708 --> 02:10:24,250
-What?
-L'Impartial lied.

1650
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:29,000
-"The Danglars fleet is still

1651
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:31,750
"afloat, moored in the port of Marseille"!

1652
02:10:31,917 --> 02:10:33,417
...

1653
02:10:33,583 --> 02:10:36,458
Thank you. Thank you, my friends.

1654
02:10:36,958 --> 02:10:39,750
-Danglars will remember my words
and he will think...

1655
02:10:39,917 --> 02:10:42,708
-That it's a blow from the new owner
of L'Impartial,

1656
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:44,417
our dear Lord Halifax.

1657
02:10:44,583 --> 02:10:45,375
-Exactly.

1658
02:10:45,542 --> 02:10:46,417
...

1659
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:48,000
-Monte-Cristo was right.

1660
02:10:48,167 --> 02:10:50,833
The Englishman uses his newspaper
to speculate at my expense.

1661
02:10:51,417 --> 02:10:52,833
-We need to publish a denial.

1662
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
...

1663
02:10:55,167 --> 02:10:56,125
-Not at all.

1664
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,208
-I don't understand. We must...

1665
02:10:58,375 --> 02:10:59,375
-Shh!

1666
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:01,500
Do you hear?

1667
02:11:02,667 --> 02:11:03,333
Listen.

1668
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,292
The nice sound.

1669
02:11:08,292 --> 02:11:09,833
That nice little sound.

1670
02:11:11,458 --> 02:11:13,667
The sound of money falling.

1671
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:15,625
-I don't understand either.

1672
02:11:15,792 --> 02:11:19,875
-Think. He knows something
that no one knows yet.

1673
02:11:20,333 --> 02:11:24,542
Imagine: you're playing poker
and you know your opponent's hand.

1674
02:11:24,958 --> 02:11:26,958
What do you do?
-I raise.

1675
02:11:27,125 --> 02:11:28,792
-The stocks are at rock bottom.

1676
02:11:29,708 --> 02:11:34,458
If I buy them back now, in two days,
I'll make a huge profit.

1677
02:11:34,625 --> 02:11:35,958
My best move.

1678
02:11:36,125 --> 02:11:37,250
-Buy back your shares?

1679
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:38,917
How much would that take?

1680
02:11:39,083 --> 02:11:40,417
-500 million.
-500 million?

1681
02:11:40,583 --> 02:11:43,833
-500 million.
But it has to be done today.

1682
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,167
Before the market closes and before
that scoundrel Halifax does.

1683
02:11:48,542 --> 02:11:51,083
-How do we find 500 million
by this evening?

1684
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:52,625
...

1685
02:11:53,542 --> 02:11:56,792
-By going to see the greatest enemy
of that Lord Halifax.

1686
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,958
...

1687
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:22,958
...

1688
02:12:24,833 --> 02:12:26,750
-I’m sorry, Baron, but...

1689
02:12:27,458 --> 02:12:29,708
the sea has always brought me bad luck.

1690
02:12:29,875 --> 02:12:31,500
I won’t buy back your stocks.

1691
02:12:31,667 --> 02:12:33,750
-Count.
-However,

1692
02:12:33,917 --> 02:12:37,000
I never refuse to help a friend
and punish an enemy.

1693
02:12:37,167 --> 02:12:40,667
So I will lend you this money
and you can do as you wish with it.

1694
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:42,208
...

1695
02:12:42,375 --> 02:12:43,458
...

1696
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,500
-And I can guarantee you
an interest rate of 20%.

1697
02:12:47,958 --> 02:12:49,917
-I will lend you money
interest-free.

1698
02:12:52,167 --> 02:12:53,000
In Sicily, they say:

1699
02:12:53,167 --> 02:12:55,125
"You won’t get rich
at the expense of a friend."

1700
02:12:55,292 --> 02:12:56,542
-I insist.

1701
02:12:57,333 --> 02:13:01,250
I had a mortgage drawn up
on all my properties.

1702
02:13:01,417 --> 02:13:04,875
So, it’s not
for 500 million, but...

1703
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,000
200 million, I promise.

1704
02:13:07,375 --> 02:13:09,500
-No, Baron, your word is enough for me.

1705
02:13:09,667 --> 02:13:11,042
-In France, they say:

1706
02:13:11,208 --> 02:13:13,375
"Good accounts make good friends."

1707
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,333
-Very well then. Out of friendship,
I accept your personal guarantees.

1708
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,125
-In a week,
I will have repaid you.

1709
02:13:26,458 --> 02:13:29,167
-We will make that Halifax
pay dearly.

1710
02:13:29,917 --> 02:13:31,417
-A complaint is ready.

1711
02:13:32,042 --> 02:13:35,542
I will personally take charge
of the proceedings against him.

1712
02:13:35,708 --> 02:13:39,667
-I can’t wait to be in court
to witness this execution.

1713
02:13:39,833 --> 02:13:41,833
...

1714
02:14:01,792 --> 02:14:04,333
-Lord Halifax,
owner of L'Impartial,

1715
02:14:04,708 --> 02:14:06,583
called to the bar today

1716
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:09,250
to answer
the charges of defamation,

1717
02:14:09,417 --> 02:14:11,667
had to leave the country in haste.

1718
02:14:11,833 --> 02:14:13,500
...

1719
02:14:13,667 --> 02:14:15,917
But he commits
to having his representative

1720
02:14:16,083 --> 02:14:18,375
before this court at 2 PM.

1721
02:14:28,875 --> 02:14:29,875
...

1722
02:14:37,333 --> 02:14:39,500
...

1723
02:14:45,292 --> 02:14:47,750
-Mr. Judge, the comedy has gone on long enough.

1724
02:14:47,917 --> 02:14:49,250
This is not the boulevards.

1725
02:14:49,417 --> 02:14:51,292
...

1726
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:55,708
-I ask the representative
of Mr. Halifax to identify himself.

1727
02:15:03,792 --> 02:15:06,458
-What are you doing? It’s not over yet.

1728
02:15:23,583 --> 02:15:25,583
-I am the representative
of Lord Halifax.

1729
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:26,958
...

1730
02:15:29,833 --> 02:15:31,208
I stand before you

1731
02:15:31,375 --> 02:15:35,208
because L'Impartial is accused
of spreading false news.

1732
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:37,458
But I assert here

1733
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:40,208
that the Danglars boats
have indeed disappeared.

1734
02:15:40,375 --> 02:15:42,708
-Nonsense,
my fleet is in Marseille!

1735
02:15:42,875 --> 02:15:44,000
-This is a farce!

1736
02:15:44,167 --> 02:15:46,333
...

1737
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,500
-What proof do you have?
-You just need to

1738
02:15:48,667 --> 02:15:51,500
contact
the port authority of Marseille.

1739
02:15:51,958 --> 02:15:55,250
-So you persist
in your claims?

1740
02:15:55,917 --> 02:15:59,708
-I persist and I sign,
Your Honor.

1741
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:02,583
But I want to do it
under my real name.

1742
02:16:02,958 --> 02:16:04,458
-You have a false one?

1743
02:16:08,042 --> 02:16:11,000
-I am known
by the name of Andrea Cavalcanti.

1744
02:16:11,167 --> 02:16:14,708
After years on the streets,
I was taken in by a great

1745
02:16:14,875 --> 02:16:17,750
and wealthy family
of the Italian aristocracy.

1746
02:16:17,917 --> 02:16:19,667
I grew up as a thief

1747
02:16:20,042 --> 02:16:21,667
and ended up a prince.

1748
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:26,208
It’s not a more honest profession,
but much more pleasant.

1749
02:16:26,375 --> 02:16:29,042
...

1750
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:33,000
It is here, in Paris,
that I finally found my real father.

1751
02:16:36,625 --> 02:16:37,958
...

1752
02:16:39,791 --> 02:16:42,416
I was born on November 3, 1815.

1753
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:46,625
In Auteuil.

1754
02:16:47,625 --> 02:16:48,625
...

1755
02:16:53,041 --> 02:16:54,666
-Mr. Judge, could...

1756
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,875
the accused present evidence
for what he claims?

1757
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:02,666
-I'm getting to that, Mr. Prosecutor.

1758
02:17:02,833 --> 02:17:05,083
Your patience will be rewarded.

1759
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:12,791
I am the bastard of a French aristocrat
and his mistress!

1760
02:17:12,958 --> 02:17:14,708
...

1761
02:17:17,125 --> 02:17:20,916
My mother does not know I am alive
because... my father

1762
02:17:21,083 --> 02:17:23,583
told her
that I died at birth.

1763
02:17:25,125 --> 02:17:27,791
He wrapped me in cloth
and buried me alive.

1764
02:17:27,958 --> 02:17:29,875
...

1765
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:33,458
-You speak, sir,
of an attempt at infanticide.

1766
02:17:35,125 --> 02:17:36,708
-That's what should have happened

1767
02:17:37,583 --> 02:17:40,500
if my aunt
had not dug me up.

1768
02:17:40,666 --> 02:17:42,291
-Who do you accuse?

1769
02:17:43,291 --> 02:17:44,958
-A respectable man...

1770
02:17:45,583 --> 02:17:46,916
whom you all know.

1771
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,875
His coat of arms is on this cloth.

1772
02:17:55,041 --> 02:17:56,708
...

1773
02:17:59,875 --> 02:18:01,000
My father...

1774
02:18:01,458 --> 02:18:04,083
is none other than the man
before me.

1775
02:18:08,416 --> 02:18:10,000
Prosecutor Villefort.

1776
02:18:10,166 --> 02:18:12,166
...

1777
02:18:15,583 --> 02:18:16,375
-Silence!

1778
02:18:16,916 --> 02:18:19,541
Or I will have the room evacuated.
-Calumny!

1779
02:18:20,208 --> 02:18:21,333
I will sue you!

1780
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:23,083
-Mr. Cavalcanti,

1781
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,875
do you understand the seriousness
of your accusations?

1782
02:18:27,041 --> 02:18:30,208
I will not settle for a cloth,
even stained with blood.

1783
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:34,291
-Mr. Prosecutor will bring you
the proof of what I assert.

1784
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:38,291
-But you are delusional!
-Father.

1785
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:40,791
 .

1786
02:18:40,958 --> 02:18:43,125
Do not force my mother
to come testify.

1787
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:45,291
She has, I believe, suffered enough.

1788
02:18:46,208 --> 02:18:49,458
...

1789
02:18:49,625 --> 02:18:51,791
...

1790
02:18:54,125 --> 02:18:56,250
...

1791
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:58,166
-The trial is suspended

1792
02:18:58,333 --> 02:19:01,208
for the duration of an inquiry.
Clear the room!

1793
02:19:03,166 --> 02:19:04,250
-And one.

1794
02:19:06,625 --> 02:19:09,125
-Come on, Victoria, let's go! Excuse me.

1795
02:19:09,875 --> 02:19:11,041
Let us pass.

1796
02:19:23,166 --> 02:19:25,250
-Why didn't you tell me the truth?

1797
02:19:26,333 --> 02:19:29,583
-Your father wanted me as a son-in-law,
but...

1798
02:19:30,583 --> 02:19:33,250
it cannot be,
your mother is also mine.

1799
02:19:36,375 --> 02:19:37,958
Do not forget your life lines.

1800
02:19:38,666 --> 02:19:40,041
Be happy, my sister.

1801
02:19:47,791 --> 02:19:51,125
...

1802
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
-Count!

1803
02:19:58,292 --> 02:19:59,292
Count!

1804
02:20:00,958 --> 02:20:04,083
This story makes no sense.
We're swimming in madness.

1805
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:07,750
My boats were still in Marseille yesterday. I...

1806
02:20:07,917 --> 02:20:12,125
I will need a...
a delay to pay you back.

1807
02:20:12,292 --> 02:20:14,208
If...

1808
02:20:15,667 --> 02:20:17,458
-You have nothing left, Baron.

1809
02:20:18,042 --> 02:20:20,208
Everything that was yours is now mine.

1810
02:20:21,042 --> 02:20:24,542
The only thing you have left
are these clothes.

1811
02:20:26,083 --> 02:20:29,083
Leave Paris, and perhaps
I will not let your wife

1812
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:31,250
and your daughter starve.

1813
02:20:31,417 --> 02:20:33,042
-But, Count, I...

1814
02:20:33,208 --> 02:20:35,625
-Do you find me brutal, Baron?

1815
02:20:38,708 --> 02:20:40,542
"Not only do I know it,

1816
02:20:41,833 --> 02:20:43,167
but I take pride in it."

1817
02:20:53,708 --> 02:20:54,875
...

1818
02:20:57,083 --> 02:20:59,542
You should escort your wife home.

1819
02:21:00,042 --> 02:21:01,458
She looks quite pale.

1820
02:21:10,458 --> 02:21:11,500
-And two.

1821
02:21:11,667 --> 02:21:13,333
...

1822
02:21:55,042 --> 02:21:55,958
-Father!

1823
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:10,542
From Angèle.

1824
02:22:11,333 --> 02:22:12,542
...

1825
02:22:24,458 --> 02:22:26,833
...

1826
02:22:35,292 --> 02:22:36,250
-Get away!

1827
02:22:36,792 --> 02:22:37,625
-No!

1828
02:22:37,792 --> 02:22:38,958
...

1829
02:22:39,417 --> 02:22:41,417
...

1830
02:22:49,833 --> 02:22:51,125
...

1831
02:22:52,875 --> 02:22:55,000
...

1832
02:22:55,542 --> 02:22:56,667
Why?

1833
02:22:58,542 --> 02:22:59,542
Why?

1834
02:23:06,042 --> 02:23:07,250
...

1835
02:23:07,417 --> 02:23:09,625
...

1836
02:23:09,792 --> 02:23:11,000
-Don't cry.

1837
02:23:11,167 --> 02:23:13,500
...

1838
02:23:13,667 --> 02:23:16,125
...

1839
02:23:16,958 --> 02:23:18,625
...

1840
02:24:30,167 --> 02:24:32,333
-We knew it would end like this.

1841
02:24:33,292 --> 02:24:34,292
We knew.

1842
02:24:34,458 --> 02:24:35,417
-Haydée!

1843
02:24:40,125 --> 02:24:41,542
He disobeyed.

1844
02:24:43,792 --> 02:24:45,250
-Disobeyed?

1845
02:24:50,167 --> 02:24:51,833
Disobeyed what?

1846
02:24:54,792 --> 02:24:56,667
You taught him nothing
but hatred.

1847
02:24:57,375 --> 02:24:59,750
You put this dagger
in his hand.

1848
02:25:03,167 --> 02:25:05,500
-It's your pain that speaks.

1849
02:25:08,333 --> 02:25:09,792
I loved him like a son.

1850
02:25:09,958 --> 02:25:11,167
...

1851
02:25:12,583 --> 02:25:14,292
...

1852
02:25:16,792 --> 02:25:18,375
-Do you love me too?

1853
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:25,958
Do you also intend
to sacrifice me for your revenge?

1854
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,792
-This is not revenge.

1855
02:25:30,167 --> 02:25:31,750
It's justice.

1856
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:40,792
Do not forget your tears, Haydée,
your mother's screams

1857
02:25:40,958 --> 02:25:42,792
and your father's blood.

1858
02:25:42,958 --> 02:25:44,750
And the name of the one who betrayed them.

1859
02:25:45,583 --> 02:25:47,125
Do not forget his name!

1860
02:25:48,375 --> 02:25:50,375
...

1861
02:25:53,250 --> 02:25:54,792
...

1862
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:58,417
...

1863
02:26:11,792 --> 02:26:12,917
...

1864
02:26:18,583 --> 02:26:19,625
-If you love me

1865
02:26:19,792 --> 02:26:22,625
as I love you,
do not seek to see me again.

1866
02:26:22,792 --> 02:26:25,250
You are too noble of heart
not to understand.

1867
02:26:25,417 --> 02:26:28,958
I keep my strength to fight
against myself and drink my tears.

1868
02:26:29,417 --> 02:26:32,583
Be happy far from me,
you deserve it.

1869
02:26:32,750 --> 02:26:33,833
...

1870
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,083
...

1871
02:26:40,917 --> 02:26:41,958
-Albert?

1872
02:27:06,208 --> 02:27:08,042
...

1873
02:27:19,583 --> 02:27:20,583
-Albert.

1874
02:27:21,708 --> 02:27:22,958
You are crazy.

1875
02:27:23,125 --> 02:27:24,500
You cannot stay.

1876
02:27:24,667 --> 02:27:26,958
-Haydée,
I have only known you for a short time...

1877
02:27:27,417 --> 02:27:28,500
-Leave.

1878
02:27:29,125 --> 02:27:31,250
Flee from me like one flees from the plague.

1879
02:27:32,333 --> 02:27:34,833
I will bring you misfortune.
-But flee with me.

1880
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:37,250
I swear to you, Haydée,

1881
02:27:37,875 --> 02:27:41,250
instead of despair,
it is happiness that I promise you.

1882
02:27:42,333 --> 02:27:45,917
-You do not know me.
You do not know the Count.

1883
02:27:46,083 --> 02:27:47,000
-Haydée...

1884
02:27:47,167 --> 02:27:48,958
-If you love me
as I love you...

1885
02:27:49,708 --> 02:27:52,125
...

1886
02:27:52,292 --> 02:27:53,750
Say goodbye to me.

1887
02:27:55,125 --> 02:27:56,333
I beg you.

1888
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:59,125
...

1889
02:27:59,667 --> 02:28:00,500
Say it!

1890
02:28:06,292 --> 02:28:07,875
-I will therefore tell you

1891
02:28:09,542 --> 02:28:12,125
testifying to God,
who reads the depths of my heart...

1892
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:18,833
I wish you
a happy life without my memory.

1893
02:28:21,917 --> 02:28:23,167
Goodbye, my love.

1894
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:25,958
-This look.

1895
02:28:30,083 --> 02:28:31,875
-Without you, my life is lost.

1896
02:28:32,458 --> 02:28:33,792
My misfortune, certain.

1897
02:28:35,042 --> 02:28:36,292
-What will you do?

1898
02:28:37,917 --> 02:28:40,583
-But rest assured,
I will keep my promise.

1899
02:28:41,292 --> 02:28:43,292
-But please, will you live?

1900
02:28:44,042 --> 02:28:45,333
-What do you care?

1901
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:49,625
In your eyes, I am already dead.

1902
02:28:58,333 --> 02:28:59,583
-Let's flee.

1903
02:29:12,792 --> 02:29:13,667
-Haydée.

1904
02:29:14,083 --> 02:29:16,667
If you wish to join
the Morcerf family,

1905
02:29:17,208 --> 02:29:18,792
Albert deserves to know

1906
02:29:18,958 --> 02:29:20,083
your story.

1907
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,208
If you remain silent,
I will be forced to speak on your behalf.

1908
02:29:27,167 --> 02:29:28,750
Must I really speak

1909
02:29:28,917 --> 02:29:30,167
in your name?

1910
02:29:30,625 --> 02:29:32,542
-Count, please.

1911
02:29:32,708 --> 02:29:34,167
-Haydée is the daughter...

1912
02:29:34,333 --> 02:29:35,542
-Stop!

1913
02:29:40,292 --> 02:29:41,625
I will speak.

1914
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,958
...

1915
02:30:00,167 --> 02:30:03,958
My father was an illustrious man
known as Ali Tebelin.

1916
02:30:07,792 --> 02:30:09,083
Pasha of Janina.

1917
02:30:16,625 --> 02:30:17,958
I was 10 years old

1918
02:30:18,417 --> 02:30:21,000
when he was killed in front of 
me and my mother.

1919
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:24,125
He had received a French soldier

1920
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,375
who was supposed to be our ally.

1921
02:30:28,625 --> 02:30:30,583
Even after being pieced by a dozen bullets,

1922
02:30:32,292 --> 02:30:33,125
my father

1923
02:30:33,292 --> 02:30:35,792
still found the strength to attack

1924
02:30:37,542 --> 02:30:39,917
the man who had sold him out

1925
02:30:42,583 --> 02:30:44,208
by putting out one of his eyes.

1926
02:30:47,125 --> 02:30:48,833
I never saw my mother again.

1927
02:30:51,708 --> 02:30:53,500
That one-eyed officer sold me
as a slave

1928
02:30:53,875 --> 02:30:55,792
to a Vlach tribe in the Balkans.

1929
02:30:57,042 --> 02:30:58,667
His name was...
-That's enough.

1930
02:30:58,833 --> 02:30:59,917
-Albert.

1931
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:08,125
-You manipulated me.
-I warned you.

1932
02:31:08,292 --> 02:31:11,542
-You used me.
-You might regret your words.

1933
02:31:11,708 --> 02:31:14,750
-You think you can scare me?
-Don't provoke me.

1934
02:31:14,917 --> 02:31:16,375
-Albert, please.

1935
02:31:16,542 --> 02:31:17,542
Count!

1936
02:31:17,708 --> 02:31:21,792
-You took everything from me.
Except my name, which you have tarnished.

1937
02:31:22,708 --> 02:31:23,500
-No!

1938
02:31:24,292 --> 02:31:26,208
Oh, count, I beg you.

1939
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,083
-I take your glove as thrown.

1940
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:32,083
I will return it
wrapped around a bullet tomorrow.

1941
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:34,417
...

1942
02:31:37,625 --> 02:31:38,792
...

1943
02:31:40,458 --> 02:31:42,083
-You have no mercy?

1944
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:44,625
-Did they show any for Edmond Dantès?

1945
02:31:45,958 --> 02:31:47,042
Look at me.

1946
02:31:47,208 --> 02:31:51,458
I am nothing but the ars
of a deaf and blind fate.

1947
02:31:51,625 --> 02:31:53,875
...

1948
02:31:54,042 --> 02:31:56,250
...

1949
02:31:56,417 --> 02:31:59,542
Fernand de Morcerf will know
what my father knew.

1950
02:31:59,708 --> 02:32:02,375
...

1951
02:32:02,542 --> 02:32:04,292
-If you kill Albert,

1952
02:32:05,125 --> 02:32:09,750
you will no longer be able to say:
"God is with me, for me."

1953
02:32:11,917 --> 02:32:13,583
You will be a murderer.

1954
02:32:14,875 --> 02:32:17,250
...

1955
02:32:17,417 --> 02:32:21,250
-The Bible says that the sons will pay
for their fathers' crimes.

1956
02:32:23,042 --> 02:32:26,042
...

1957
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:30,333
Jacopo, follow her.

1958
02:33:06,375 --> 02:33:07,625
...

1959
02:33:10,958 --> 02:33:12,417
Leave us, Jacopo.

1960
02:33:14,583 --> 02:33:15,708
Madam.

1961
02:33:16,458 --> 02:33:17,875
What are you doing here?

1962
02:33:18,708 --> 02:33:20,667
-Edmond, you will not kill my son.

1963
02:33:22,167 --> 02:33:23,708
-What name did you utter?

1964
02:33:24,333 --> 02:33:25,333
-Yours.

1965
02:33:26,875 --> 02:33:28,250
-It's not Madame de Morcerf

1966
02:33:28,417 --> 02:33:30,167
who stands before you; it's Mercédès.

1967
02:33:30,542 --> 02:33:32,500
-I don't know anyone by that name.

1968
02:33:32,667 --> 02:33:34,000
...

1969
02:33:35,333 --> 02:33:37,125
-I recognized you as soon as I saw you.

1970
02:33:38,417 --> 02:33:40,875
And even without seeing you,
I would have recognized your voice.

1971
02:33:41,042 --> 02:33:45,042
My mind struggled, but my heart knew.
Since then, I've been following you, watching you,

1972
02:33:45,208 --> 02:33:47,125
I seek what you want at Morcerf.

1973
02:33:47,292 --> 02:33:49,625
-Fernand, you mean, madam.

1974
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:52,750
Since we are recalling our first names.

1975
02:33:55,917 --> 02:33:57,292
-The guilty one is me.

1976
02:33:59,292 --> 02:34:02,083
It is I who lacked strength
in the face of your absence.

1977
02:34:03,167 --> 02:34:05,792
It is I who lacked faith
in your death.

1978
02:34:05,958 --> 02:34:09,625
Me!
-Why? Why were you alone?

1979
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:13,250
Why was I absent?
Why was I arrested?

1980
02:34:13,833 --> 02:34:16,167
Why was I declared dead?

1981
02:34:16,333 --> 02:34:17,708
-I don't know.

1982
02:34:17,875 --> 02:34:20,917
...

1983
02:34:21,583 --> 02:34:24,625
-I imagine he no longer writes you
love letters,

1984
02:34:24,792 --> 02:34:27,500
but you will easily recognize
his handwriting.

1985
02:34:30,667 --> 02:34:31,667
Here.

1986
02:34:32,792 --> 02:34:34,417
Look, Mercédès.

1987
02:34:36,667 --> 02:34:38,542
Here is what your husband wrote

1988
02:34:38,708 --> 02:34:40,667
to Villefort twenty years ago.

1989
02:34:40,833 --> 02:34:43,042
...

1990
02:34:43,208 --> 02:34:44,208
...

1991
02:34:44,375 --> 02:34:48,375
I must take my revenge, Mercédès.
It is necessary.

1992
02:34:48,542 --> 02:34:50,792
...

1993
02:34:50,958 --> 02:34:52,667
-Then take your revenge, Edmond.

1994
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,333
But on the guilty ones.

1995
02:34:58,958 --> 02:35:03,375
Revenge yourself on Fernand who betrayed you,
revenge yourself on me, but spare Albert.

1996
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:10,000
If you knew all the prayers...

1997
02:35:10,167 --> 02:35:13,292
...

1998
02:35:13,458 --> 02:35:16,042
If you knew all the tears
I have shed...

1999
02:35:16,542 --> 02:35:19,167
-Did you lose your father in solitude?

2000
02:35:19,333 --> 02:35:23,125
Did you see the one you loved
in the arms of your rival?

2001
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:27,333
-Did you see all of that?
-No.

2002
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:29,500
-Yes.

2003
02:35:31,042 --> 02:35:33,750
-But I see the man
whom I have never stopped loving

2004
02:35:34,208 --> 02:35:36,375
ready to become the murderer of my son.

2005
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:52,500
-What do you want?

2006
02:35:56,042 --> 02:35:57,958
Do you want your son to live?

2007
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,333
He will live.

2008
02:36:01,458 --> 02:36:02,625
...

2009
02:36:04,333 --> 02:36:05,375
-Thank you.

2010
02:36:07,125 --> 02:36:08,417
Thank you, Edmond.

2011
02:36:10,042 --> 02:36:11,917
...

2012
02:36:12,542 --> 02:36:13,583
...

2013
02:36:14,083 --> 02:36:15,667
I find you again.

2014
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:21,792
As I have always dreamed of you,
as I have always loved you.

2015
02:36:39,417 --> 02:36:41,208
-We must say goodbye.

2016
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
-Goodbye?

2017
02:36:46,833 --> 02:36:48,875
-If I renounce taking justice into my own hands,

2018
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:52,167
I renounce what keeps me alive.

2019
02:36:55,917 --> 02:36:57,750
The duel will take place tomorrow.

2020
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:01,875
Goodbye, Mercédès.

2021
02:37:05,625 --> 02:37:07,833
...

2022
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:13,083
...

2023
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:15,250
-Mister Albert de Morcerf,

2024
02:37:15,583 --> 02:37:18,833
you have publicly challenged
the Count of Monte Cristo.

2025
02:37:19,458 --> 02:37:22,375
The duel will take place at twenty paces,
at my command.

2026
02:37:23,375 --> 02:37:24,875
Priority to the offended.

2027
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,583
Ready.

2028
02:37:34,292 --> 02:37:35,417
Go, gentlemen.

2029
02:37:58,375 --> 02:37:59,375
Fire!

2030
02:38:04,458 --> 02:38:05,583
...

2031
02:38:21,208 --> 02:38:25,542
...

2032
02:38:26,375 --> 02:38:27,375
Fire!

2033
02:38:56,917 --> 02:38:58,667
...

2034
02:38:58,833 --> 02:38:59,625
...

2035
02:38:59,792 --> 02:39:02,792
...

2036
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:15,167
-I believe I see in your eyes
a glimmer of disappointment.

2037
02:39:17,125 --> 02:39:20,750
-I will never forgive you
for taking his life

2038
02:39:21,792 --> 02:39:23,458
and for tearing my heart out.

2039
02:39:26,125 --> 02:39:27,542
-So you loved him.

2040
02:39:28,792 --> 02:39:30,125
-Did I love him?

2041
02:39:32,083 --> 02:39:35,792
Everything urged me to hate him,
but who knows why one falls in love?

2042
02:39:36,125 --> 02:39:39,833
You can try to reason with yourself,
but it’s too late.

2043
02:39:40,250 --> 02:39:41,833
You have lost your balance.

2044
02:39:44,583 --> 02:39:47,625
Your secret voice whispers to you
that there is no more chance.

2045
02:39:48,125 --> 02:39:51,750
But instead of listening to that voice,
it was yours that I listened to.

2046
02:39:54,208 --> 02:39:56,500
I have brought about his misfortune and mine!

2047
02:39:58,958 --> 02:40:02,667
What will I do with this love
that I did not give him?

2048
02:40:04,292 --> 02:40:07,042
With these words that I did not say to him?

2049
02:40:09,333 --> 02:40:11,208
-You said them to him.

2050
02:40:11,375 --> 02:40:13,458
...

2051
02:40:13,625 --> 02:40:14,917
And he heard them.

2052
02:40:19,083 --> 02:40:22,333
...

2053
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:23,583
-Albert...

2054
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:26,000
...

2055
02:40:39,208 --> 02:40:40,458
-Count!

2056
02:40:47,875 --> 02:40:49,375
-Run away, now.

2057
02:40:50,083 --> 02:40:52,792
Run away and do not let anyone
steal your happiness.

2058
02:41:11,083 --> 02:41:12,667
...

2059
02:41:32,792 --> 02:41:33,458
-Edmond!

2060
02:41:40,042 --> 02:41:41,042
Edmond!

2061
02:41:46,667 --> 02:41:48,542
Edmond, show yourself!

2062
02:41:54,333 --> 02:41:55,708
-I was waiting for you.

2063
02:41:56,833 --> 02:41:58,875
-You finally show your true face.

2064
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,292
-I sought to know yours.

2065
02:42:03,542 --> 02:42:04,875
To know who you were.

2066
02:42:06,625 --> 02:42:08,167
So I followed your traces.

2067
02:42:09,042 --> 02:42:10,958
I went everywhere you went.

2068
02:42:12,875 --> 02:42:14,583
I met them all:

2069
02:42:15,417 --> 02:42:18,792
your friends, your comrades-in-arms,
your enemies, all...

2070
02:42:20,167 --> 02:42:21,583
Who did you not betray?

2071
02:42:23,083 --> 02:42:24,917
To whom have you remained faithful?

2072
02:42:25,542 --> 02:42:27,833
Everywhere, you showed your true face.

2073
02:42:28,875 --> 02:42:29,625
-I have lost

2074
02:42:29,792 --> 02:42:31,208
faith in Man,

2075
02:42:31,583 --> 02:42:33,333
the day you betrayed me.

2076
02:42:35,458 --> 02:42:37,000
-You should have killed me.

2077
02:42:37,167 --> 02:42:38,625
-It’s never too late.

2078
02:42:44,625 --> 02:42:45,708
...

2079
02:42:49,542 --> 02:42:50,792
...

2080
02:43:12,833 --> 02:43:14,417
...

2081
02:43:16,833 --> 02:43:17,583
...

2082
02:43:22,917 --> 02:43:23,917
...

2083
02:43:24,583 --> 02:43:25,625
...

2084
02:43:32,375 --> 02:43:33,458
...

2085
02:43:34,375 --> 02:43:36,542
...

2086
02:43:44,542 --> 02:43:45,875
...

2087
02:43:46,042 --> 02:43:47,125
...

2088
02:43:49,542 --> 02:43:52,958
...

2089
02:43:53,125 --> 02:43:54,000
...

2090
02:43:54,167 --> 02:43:58,125
...

2091
02:43:58,292 --> 02:43:59,333
...

2092
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:01,333
...

2093
02:44:07,333 --> 02:44:10,500
...

2094
02:44:15,708 --> 02:44:16,375
...

2095
02:44:17,333 --> 02:44:18,333
...

2096
02:44:21,542 --> 02:44:24,083
...

2097
02:44:24,250 --> 02:44:26,208
...

2098
02:44:30,125 --> 02:44:33,333
...

2099
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,958
...

2100
02:44:38,542 --> 02:44:39,625
...

2101
02:44:39,792 --> 02:44:43,625
...

2102
02:44:48,333 --> 02:44:50,042
...

2103
02:44:51,833 --> 02:44:52,875
...

2104
02:44:53,042 --> 02:44:54,583
...

2105
02:44:59,167 --> 02:45:03,333
...

2106
02:45:16,583 --> 02:45:17,583
...

2107
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:19,833
...

2108
02:45:56,833 --> 02:45:59,583
...

2109
02:46:21,667 --> 02:46:22,417
...

2110
02:46:23,708 --> 02:46:25,042
...

2111
02:46:38,500 --> 02:46:39,792
Get up.

2112
02:46:43,042 --> 02:46:43,792
...

2113
02:46:47,375 --> 02:46:50,708
...

2114
02:47:00,583 --> 02:47:01,833
-Look at me.

2115
02:47:02,583 --> 02:47:03,708
Look at me!

2116
02:47:03,875 --> 02:47:06,958
...

2117
02:47:07,125 --> 02:47:07,958
-Kill me.

2118
02:47:10,875 --> 02:47:13,042
-We always find greatness
in the dead.

2119
02:47:14,167 --> 02:47:15,875
In the end, we forgive them.

2120
02:47:21,833 --> 02:47:23,625
I don't want anyone to forgive you.

2121
02:47:58,833 --> 02:48:01,833
...

2122
02:48:36,375 --> 02:48:39,667
Mercédès, I came to say goodbye

2123
02:48:39,833 --> 02:48:41,875
where life
tore us apart,

2124
02:48:42,042 --> 02:48:43,667
twenty-one years ago today.

2125
02:48:44,333 --> 02:48:48,000
So much has broken within me
and around me since then,

2126
02:48:48,167 --> 02:48:50,208
that the man you knew is no more.

2127
02:48:50,792 --> 02:48:53,083
I promised to love you
until my death

2128
02:48:53,250 --> 02:48:54,917
and long after,

2129
02:48:55,417 --> 02:48:57,125
and I will always love you,

2130
02:48:57,292 --> 02:49:00,208
but it is no longer in my power
to bring you happiness.

2131
02:49:00,958 --> 02:49:03,500
I can only offer you
consolation now.

2132
02:49:04,458 --> 02:49:06,292
Your son will be happy.

2133
02:49:06,708 --> 02:49:10,417
Albert and Haydée will live the story
that we could not live.

2134
02:49:10,583 --> 02:49:12,250
Happiness to our children

2135
02:49:12,625 --> 02:49:15,917
who will survive us
and taste the sweetness of love.

2136
02:49:17,417 --> 02:49:20,208
As I write to you,
I live my last moments with you.

2137
02:49:20,792 --> 02:49:23,833
Everything after will be just memories.

2138
02:49:24,458 --> 02:49:26,917
I will carry them with me across the sea,

2139
02:49:27,500 --> 02:49:29,750
the only place on earth
where everything is horizon

2140
02:49:30,292 --> 02:49:33,083
and where there are no traces
left by men.

2141
02:49:34,333 --> 02:49:36,625
Live and be happy.

2142
02:49:37,333 --> 02:49:38,417
Never forget,

2143
02:49:38,583 --> 02:49:42,000
until the day when providence
may reunite us again,

2144
02:49:42,167 --> 02:49:45,083
that all human wisdom
is contained in these two words:

2145
02:49:45,667 --> 02:49:46,917
wait

2146
02:49:47,083 --> 02:49:48,417
and hope.

2147
02:49:50,625 --> 02:49:52,125
Edmond Dantès,

2148
02:49:52,292 --> 02:49:54,500
Count of Monte Cristo.
